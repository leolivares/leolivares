7 18 have to be sort of
15 21 to pass for more than
71 17 at the sound of a
7 19 like to get on with
17 23 are going to think that

6 26 to stability in the region
34 18 so long as they do
12 27 contributed to a decline in

9 20 the show is based on
12 28 responses to the question of
7 26 the ability to think about
7 26 one pays much attention to
68 18 and i want them to
133 20 you are going to see

11 21 up to this point that

7 22 first time he had done
7 28 a tremendous amount of pride
37 26 share stories and of those
21 20 i know what it feels
8 24 it makes sense that they
6 23 up a newspaper and read
15 26 he was the first president
8 22 going to work this out
8 24 his eyes and leaned back
6 32 was against this background that
8 24 like nothing else in the

8 28 percent during the same time
19 26 that could happen would be
9 19 can think of to get
16 24 might be on to something
21 19 that if you have to
12 18 be done by the end
9 17 he is at his best
13 23 is of a different order
43 18 but i think we are
7 21 idea what i wanted to
8 26 imagine what that would be
8 21 had a couple of other
15 26 was reason to believe that
6 32 a constant source of inspiration
13 19 which was kind of a
8 21 both on the field and
6 34 director of science and technology
8 18 halt in front of a
9 18 find out if he has
10 21 that one day we would
19 25 a few questions about the

11 27 the company is working with
7 23 afraid we were going to
9 21 what else is he going
7 27 more than the equivalent of
9 17 he only had a few

8 30 were asking an average initial
6 28 escalated to the point where
8 22 could take it or leave
24 22 with a silver spoon in
6 19 about him an air of
8 17 long as he was in
13 18 by that i mean the
7 22 come up out of nowhere
6 25 lot of people thought you
26 15 i look at it is
6 19 and bent to pick up
7 28 many people were involved in
6 25 that happened a couple of
6 20 of the stones in the
18 18 in the center is a
7 26 the united states faces in
19 18 he steps up to the
27 24 she looked into his eyes
7 17 be one of the new
6 22 places a great deal of
6 24 who have come to america
6 27 would be the centerpiece of
7 19 that and i think we
8 24 one of those writers who
8 21 and decided to have a
6 22 going to explain to us
6 24 at least on the internet
7 25 means of earning a living
6 26 of spending more time with
6 20 from his nose to his

12 16 have a shot at a
6 20 the answer is not as
7 27 justified on the grounds of

13 25 at temperatures as low as
7 21 a new set of concerns
6 18 a day on which the
8 26 inches from source of heat
53 23 of the state of florida
7 29 determine the adequacy of the

20 27 eastern half of the country

6 25 greatest fear is that the
10 24 reasons i wrote the book
6 21 he listed a number of
8 22 to jump out the window
6 21 will be played at the
11 22 that the choice of the

7 20 will have a range of
11 18 a bit of olive oil
8 22 to educate them on the

7 21 of one of the century
49 23 that they are no longer

15 18 get a sense of who
18 22 it is time to consider

12 19 and this may not be
8 18 like when i was in
6 18 we spoke to one of
22 33 steroids and human growth hormone
7 16 so i think if he

10 15 a part of me as
8 25 in a conference call that
11 24 on the opposite sides of

6 21 it just sounds like a
10 20 in this paper can be
12 22 and a sense of purpose
8 17 we can go down to
