7 18 have to be sort of
15 21 to pass for more than
71 17 at the sound of a
7 19 like to get on with
17 23 are going to think that

6 26 to stability in the region
34 18 so long as they do
12 27 contributed to a decline in

9 20 the show is based on
12 28 responses to the question of
7 26 the ability to think about
7 26 one pays much attention to
68 18 and i want them to
133 20 you are going to see

11 21 up to this point that

7 22 first time he had done
7 28 a tremendous amount of pride
37 26 share stories and of those
21 20 i know what it feels
8 24 it makes sense that they
6 23 up a newspaper and read
15 26 he was the first president
8 22 going to work this out
8 24 his eyes and leaned back
6 32 was against this background that
8 24 like nothing else in the

8 28 percent during the same time
19 26 that could happen would be
9 19 can think of to get
16 24 might be on to something
21 19 that if you have to
12 18 be done by the end
9 17 he is at his best
13 23 is of a different order
43 18 but i think we are
7 21 idea what i wanted to
8 26 imagine what that would be
8 21 had a couple of other
15 26 was reason to believe that
6 32 a constant source of inspiration
13 19 which was kind of a
8 21 both on the field and
6 34 director of science and technology
8 18 halt in front of a
9 18 find out if he has
10 21 that one day we would
19 25 a few questions about the

11 27 the company is working with
7 23 afraid we were going to
9 21 what else is he going
7 27 more than the equivalent of
9 17 he only had a few

8 30 were asking an average initial
6 28 escalated to the point where
8 22 could take it or leave
24 22 with a silver spoon in
6 19 about him an air of
8 17 long as he was in
13 18 by that i mean the
7 22 come up out of nowhere
6 25 lot of people thought you
26 15 i look at it is
6 19 and bent to pick up
7 28 many people were involved in
6 25 that happened a couple of
6 20 of the stones in the
18 18 in the center is a
7 26 the united states faces in
19 18 he steps up to the
27 24 she looked into his eyes
7 17 be one of the new
6 22 places a great deal of
6 24 who have come to america
6 27 would be the centerpiece of
7 19 that and i think we
8 24 one of those writers who
8 21 and decided to have a
6 22 going to explain to us
6 24 at least on the internet
7 25 means of earning a living
6 26 of spending more time with
6 20 from his nose to his

12 16 have a shot at a
6 20 the answer is not as
7 27 justified on the grounds of

13 25 at temperatures as low as
7 21 a new set of concerns
6 18 a day on which the
8 26 inches from source of heat
53 23 of the state of florida
7 29 determine the adequacy of the

20 27 eastern half of the country

6 25 greatest fear is that the
10 24 reasons i wrote the book
6 21 he listed a number of
8 22 to jump out the window
6 21 will be played at the
11 22 that the choice of the

7 20 will have a range of
11 18 a bit of olive oil
8 22 to educate them on the

7 21 of one of the century
49 23 that they are no longer

15 18 get a sense of who
18 22 it is time to consider

12 19 and this may not be
8 18 like when i was in
6 18 we spoke to one of
22 33 steroids and human growth hormone
7 16 so i think if he

10 15 a part of me as
8 25 in a conference call that
11 24 on the opposite sides of

6 21 it just sounds like a
10 20 in this paper can be
12 22 and a sense of purpose
8 17 we can go down to

8 20 going to go away any
6 17 are we out of the
21 22 of the people i talked
24 21 back a little bit and
6 14 me a hug and a
7 19 of time in which we
7 23 pointed a finger at her
6 22 chance to look at this
7 20 at her as she walked

14 19 i think what we did
16 24 probably due to the fact
9 22 do not know whether or
9 25 be a little careful about
39 24 i was wondering if there
9 30 the fabric of american society
11 28 of the children and families

9 24 in a free and democratic
6 18 we want to go into
8 19 it very much if you
12 23 as a civil rights issue
16 22 the needs and wants of

7 21 as a president of the

10 18 with him to try to
6 18 get us out of iraq
6 18 me when i tell him
30 20 be able to make that
9 17 and see if you do

6 23 us to the next question
7 22 have been ahead of the
8 20 was that i needed to
7 18 but all the same i
11 26 everyone knows that if you
52 21 who are trying to get
7 16 to do so well in
13 19 naked in front of a
13 23 all depends on how much
28 24 to the united states but
7 21 to grace the cover of
11 21 have more than one or
14 19 at that point i had
6 22 there was a girl named
12 19 the man he is today
11 30 anything whatsoever to do with
22 18 and at the risk of
9 25 that would have been like
6 18 the crack of a bat
26 18 and no one will be
12 24 of the materials used in
7 22 been in touch with his
6 28 of dollars worth of property
6 19 much as they do now
6 21 that are hard to find
15 23 is survived by two sons
6 22 for ways to make their
8 27 the number of households in
17 17 and doing it in a
7 21 itself as part of the
7 23 clinton of new york and
12 23 and decided it would be
17 20 he was laid off from
29 32 midway through the third quarter
9 23 amazed by the number of

7 20 of the units will be
10 23 you are going to change
6 32 the discovery of nuclear fission
29 33 the construction and operation of
12 24 do something to make the
7 20 eyes as he looked at
9 23 that set him apart from
6 24 the space program in the
7 24 can be observed that the
13 22 finished by the end of
8 17 be in a few years
8 19 a pair of boots and
15 15 is a kind of an
34 24 that something had to be
8 22 a moment and looked at
6 20 to a system based on
8 19 it mean to be human
11 21 tell you what you are
25 16 in the west as a
6 24 in the groves of academe
8 20 i was so nervous and
23 18 what can i do with
10 22 but now i realize that
11 23 i picked my way through
25 22 i really think this is
6 22 out the best places to
8 24 the president is able to
11 19 if there are two or
10 22 that there are tens of
37 23 and i have been friends
6 21 i should start at the
18 30 members of the house judiciary
13 26 to figure out what exactly
11 18 when he was a high
14 17 to do with a lack
7 17 can get a jump on
8 22 are not what they were
6 18 a lot of the staff
13 25 there would have been the
27 27 a tremendous amount of work
10 22 of good things to come
9 22 the point that i could
20 31 us again next wednesday evening
7 27 what he was getting himself
6 18 as long as it kept
14 26 disagree a little bit with
9 19 is that it may have
23 16 that i was on my
12 17 or the rest of us
6 32 it was physically impossible for
14 23 wanted to know how many

6 21 votes in favor of the
7 26 head of the biceps femoris

7 21 i will be looking for
6 30 in a news conference yesterday
6 22 who are friends of the
6 25 side of the promised land
11 19 it is hard to avoid
9 14 and if i am to
6 22 with the support of mr

8 21 the fact that not one
6 27 have been working for years
6 23 because it needed to be
7 25 were many people who were
6 25 eventually turn out to be
8 23 a lot better shape than

18 24 get as close as possible
6 28 special attention is paid to
13 23 the things that went on

6 19 in my view at least
15 27 the way the american people
14 16 i will see to it
7 19 what he said he did
29 25 of the respondents in the
6 16 of the work i do
8 19 so proud of the way
12 21 three of the top five

6 23 it had to be incredibly
12 19 to stay away from a
7 35 study questions inserted before the

9 26 there were simply too many
6 20 as often as he would
10 34 industrialized nation in the world

8 23 the economy went into a
9 30 under the assumption that they
6 24 a lot of different roles
6 23 they came to terms with
11 26 over a prolonged period of

6 18 he was a burly man
9 22 to shape the course of
6 30 the most fundamental change in

8 20 like to see what you
8 26 more than three times what
98 23 bottom line is that the

6 20 the long run i think
18 21 those of us who think

20 25 that is not what happened
14 19 i hope you will not

14 23 this way of thinking is
10 17 come up to you in
9 25 that the intention of the

7 23 the best hitters in the

7 25 on the condition that you
6 17 so i know how you
8 20 stop on the way home
9 22 the perfect way to end

16 21 because i had no idea
13 24 that the location of the
6 20 pain in the neck for

6 23 and in that instant the
6 26 are there other factors at

15 21 so my question to you
6 35 frequently worked problems on their

7 19 the best to both of
7 19 of making it in the
7 25 be reached for comment on

8 23 refused to talk to them
18 23 a strong message to the

6 17 know i have to do
6 21 as they came down the

9 31 levels of identification with a
38 22 had no interest in the
8 25 a conversation he had had
18 21 need to watch out for
7 19 in the town and the
23 21 a lot of common sense
24 26 he joins us each wednesday
6 22 i lean my head against
6 27 there is no disagreement on
8 19 but there was a bit
29 18 it could be a long
6 22 idea of what they want
11 17 you a lot of time
20 22 ushered in a period of
7 37 of the most significant contributions
8 22 the taste in his mouth
6 25 are more important in the
14 17 i want to just go
7 19 would love it if we
38 19 is a normal part of
7 24 with the parents and the
6 19 and as he starts to
15 25 people out in the country
11 18 too much of a rush
10 18 a long line of men
21 19 we have a chance of
6 20 of wind power in the
6 28 might not necessarily be the
14 18 of the car and ran
21 20 to look back and see
8 26 the general manager at the
23 19 but i think part of
11 21 was forced to live in
6 25 grains are tender to bite
9 19 some more in just a
7 20 to run on a platform
7 25 they were eight years old
6 27 tilting her head toward the
8 24 to put all this together
12 19 as one of the seven
11 18 to pay for his own
9 27 important thing that we can
7 21 at the level that you
20 22 during a time when the
6 21 the bad part about it
6 23 be the method of choice
13 22 for them in the future
34 21 the people who do the
8 20 you can really get a
12 22 have to live with what
9 20 with the tone of the
7 24 that more than a hundred
7 22 but what you have here
7 20 and he came out with
6 19 was to take part in
8 23 it was apparent that he
6 22 i come to realize that
18 24 he would have known that
7 22 he got home that night
22 23 just a fraction of what
6 25 and therefore part of the
6 23 or one thing or another
6 26 there is strong support in
6 19 a play in which the
6 17 have to pay to be
6 21 as much time with her
25 20 hell am i doing here
7 16 and i know who i
6 19 some of you want to
14 17 to a new class of
6 23 the need for a balanced
24 20 you think it was the
12 24 have happened if she had
38 22 the best way to reduce
8 22 was wearing a ski mask
9 25 although i think that the
6 18 at a time and they
9 26 never taking his eyes from
6 19 down in the wake of
6 16 a lot to lose if
14 24 found that those who ate
7 26 a high potential for abuse
16 20 they told me that it
6 21 must now be put aside
10 19 more than a few are
17 21 else you can think of
25 19 set up a task force
6 24 not think that we should
7 18 to get you to take
9 27 these people have in common
17 19 they can get to the
10 27 think of anything else that
17 28 big brothers and big sisters
7 26 to be more independent and
7 27 in a choral or instrumental
10 24 on what would become the
11 34 americans have no health insurance
48 20 in a large saute pan
6 30 who identified herself only as
13 26 the golden age of american
9 24 think you can talk about
11 19 but this is a whole
8 24 balance of power in this
10 20 for the fact is that
8 21 he climbed out of bed
6 22 that she was not ready
8 28 solution to this problem was
9 24 give you my phone number
8 23 what were you hoping to
14 22 and what it stands for
6 18 to appear as if it
8 21 they wanted to see me
22 23 and ceo of the american
6 35 relationship with anna nicole smith
16 23 men stare at each other
6 32 by state and federal authorities
6 15 as he came to a

7 19 but he does want to
7 28 the shortage of primary care
11 20 a good place to meet
11 22 well before the end of
6 27 came to the conclusion they
10 24 the truth about the past
35 20 make you feel like a
8 20 to portray this as a
6 22 the rest of us because
7 19 that is so not true
6 24 been used for decades in
29 26 a professor of religion at
6 19 were a lot of great
6 22 and enlist the help of
9 18 it is best for the
30 27 are more concerned with the
19 29 to our viewers throughout the
6 24 we can agree to disagree
7 21 how much he loved the
6 23 to take up the position
6 19 it all away from me
17 19 was in dire need of
29 34 paying particular attention to the
6 26 he would not recognize the
6 20 the vote was five to
6 21 here just a few weeks
30 21 of what we might call
15 33 inside and outside the government
11 31 the world trade center disaster
13 21 and the time had come
6 27 the rest of the republicans
10 24 would probably be in the
18 30 the attitudes and behaviors of
7 19 and i have to start
7 26 a disastrous effect on the

7 19 and the pain of the
11 20 seems to be a matter
8 19 have to help me out
6 21 in the roles of women
24 24 many times have you seen
20 21 that he would soon be
6 27 on the right combination of
13 23 had not seen each other
11 23 check in with you again
8 25 does not mention that the
7 25 would like to change that
13 22 against the use of the
82 23 to have to do something
7 24 driving along in the car
9 23 outside of the realm of

26 19 top of the list for
8 23 is able to do something
10 23 people who can tell you
114 23 the role of religion in
16 27 from the countryside to the
8 18 he has seen in the
10 28 there were people who wanted
13 24 in the face of terrorism
7 17 as a site for the
9 30 the vast amount of information
6 23 four boys and two girls
13 20 had to do with their
6 19 at the crown of the
11 26 not looking forward to the
10 19 just what i need to
6 21 it also makes it more
6 20 that can be used and
17 24 interview at his home in
6 21 point here is that if
42 24 in the development of an
20 22 she came home from the
7 28 nearly two decades after the
12 20 times as many as the
9 27 the place where it happened
7 23 have a solution to this
26 26 just the beginning of what
9 19 get out of jail and
8 23 ordered a glass of wine
15 21 in what she hoped was
8 21 she hopped out of the
13 22 that he just wanted to
19 18 you have got to do
11 19 why they want to be
12 27 under the general rubric of
6 21 to the members of our
7 15 way i can do it
8 25 deal with the problems we
6 22 clear that there are a
8 27 color drained from her face
6 26 the things that went wrong
6 21 bush said that he was
7 20 and we were not able
7 24 in the religious life of

6 32 exactly what happened during the

6 15 want to do me a
6 22 within our power to do
9 26 the first three letters of
13 21 the world that we can
7 34 were classified according to their
11 25 whether they wanted to or
25 25 you have the feeling that
12 21 as she was growing up
10 20 to let her know what
6 22 i thought again of the
9 22 doing is trying to get
7 22 not good enough to get

7 18 to get all of your
8 19 i wake to the sound
7 22 up all night trying to
6 25 times as likely to commit
11 25 will do anything to avoid
6 22 know how much you hate
6 23 would spend most of the
7 16 in my life to do
11 19 whole time i was in
9 18 told me that it is
122 33 difference between life and death
7 18 to the end of june
7 19 and the west in the
6 22 in the public eye with
6 20 you talk about it as
7 19 and told him what a
6 17 and he sat at the
15 25 after he was convicted of
7 20 be judged not by the
25 20 he was going to beat
15 21 that this was a great
9 19 what did you say in
6 16 can do it or not
6 24 then he switched off the
7 19 far to the right as
7 25 enough sense to know that
11 23 because he was a friend
39 19 to be able to raise
10 24 rank right up there with
21 24 to conceal the fact that
7 22 is supposed to make it
8 24 it can be predicted that
13 19 i was still a child
30 22 the last two years has
8 18 out his hand to me
9 21 line from his home in
11 21 and that gives you an
8 44 significant positive correlation between the
7 28 the entrepreneur of the year
8 20 is the first and the
14 20 in the blue light of
6 30 bush signed an executive order
9 19 but for much of the
10 18 they did so in the
9 19 that you can use in
7 19 back to my old self
7 24 from the state of hawaii
9 19 i guess if you were
6 25 that this has become such
9 24 million so far this year
11 21 one of the arab world
6 23 is impossible not to be
7 15 in any way as a
6 19 to go on trial next
32 18 they told me i had
9 17 for it to be done
7 22 on all of these things
15 24 because he knew he could
11 26 country music hall of fame
7 24 could become a source of
12 25 have been waiting for him
6 20 heard a sound like a
14 21 get on the other side
61 24 found at the crime scene
14 23 there a couple of times
6 33 not comment on pending litigation
10 21 but would you like to
6 17 with us in just a
7 27 to determine what they want
32 19 can take care of it
8 20 in favor of the bush
6 18 but at least i got
21 21 that they may be able
6 22 so we believe that the
10 22 their way to make sure
8 23 have had a great impact
6 25 stop in the united states
28 29 national nielsen rating and a
14 21 he spent a great deal

6 25 scandal in the history of
23 18 i was there at the
19 28 the iraqi government and the
60 23 through the lens of the

16 26 when she realized that she

10 22 that comes out of that
10 23 to think that they will

7 23 any of our stories this
9 23 such as the collapse of

54 20 they want to get out
8 16 not in any way a
10 23 see how many people are
6 24 these are the items that
15 17 i going to say to
113 27 professor of history at the
89 17 meant a lot to me
9 19 we have a whole set
55 19 let me ask you what
7 21 inside the top of the
9 25 decided to put together a
7 27 for a different reason than
7 19 is a place that can
10 25 of the general public and
7 15 and so i was in
12 32 view an online exclusive gallery
72 24 people are going to look
9 17 of the men he had
11 21 when we got there and
6 24 if congress does not act
6 49 perceptions of mathematics teaching effectiveness
8 27 when they returned from the
8 18 to be sure we were
20 21 a hand over his mouth
8 17 i plan on being a
26 23 the pieces are in place
7 19 it would be way too
7 23 are being driven by the
6 28 the us department of defense
6 21 in love with the town
44 18 that this is a man
9 24 interested in what i was
7 23 the rest of your makeup
10 32 be attributed to several factors
11 17 at one of the few
7 18 he comes to a stop
7 24 one last thing before we
65 16 to say that i am
13 23 you just came back from
15 24 it may not be surprising
16 24 been defined in terms of
8 20 put her mind at ease
6 24 tired of waiting for you
7 19 hour to get back to
6 27 i hope they understand that
6 18 or two in front of
6 21 said he also wants to
6 25 to gain the acceptance of
9 22 woman who works in the
15 23 being talked about as a
7 30 society like the united states
6 19 and present it as a
66 20 far as he could tell
14 20 in the west has been
6 21 we sat and talked for
8 22 none of us can predict
19 27 there was absolutely no way
8 34 the global measure of satisfaction
9 29 are the direct descendants of
9 25 the sequence in which the
6 28 an independent think tank in
6 27 talking about when you were
6 22 and i bought our first
9 25 the image of the american
6 17 is as far as they
23 29 concerned about the impact of
6 23 had a little problem in
14 32 of the reagan administration and
7 19 to drive out of the
19 24 of the most sought after
7 20 one thing he did not
6 21 when the men are gone
18 28 there was something about it
10 24 which should have been a
7 35 showed a significant improvement in
6 23 closer look at the four
12 19 is about to take us
188 19 the end of the show
7 19 was the name of his
9 22 was teaching me how to
6 34 people with disabilities and their
11 27 beginning of the season and
16 24 to recognize that we are
7 29 turning her attention back to
6 22 what do we learn about
6 22 back on meet the press
17 17 looks at me for a
7 19 be just as happy to
6 21 whole lot more than a
15 26 and editor at science news
7 21 and then he found out
8 29 three themes emerged from the
7 27 much more difficult for him
7 21 bends down to pick it
23 23 focus of this study was
23 20 place at the head of
10 20 your way back to the
6 26 are fed up with washington
11 25 deliver on the promise of
21 18 i am not an expert
17 21 had been picked up by
10 23 wants to speak with you
31 20 the rest of the ship
8 21 they come and they go
9 29 think that the government has
8 27 lot of the information that
11 21 my hope would be that
6 26 so i think the republicans
6 37 of the philadelphia police department
35 21 that i was looking at
6 22 and every time you get
8 23 telling her that he had
15 21 of the person who was
12 17 he was so nice to
29 17 i tell you that i
8 12 by e b and e
10 23 that the first thing we
13 19 not the one who has
7 18 had quite a bit to
151 20 from the time of the
6 20 may be unique to the
46 22 they are the result of
7 17 in a sink full of
16 25 almost half a century ago
7 25 the demands of the moment
10 17 is to invest in a
15 26 human rights abuses in the
6 17 he made a trip to
6 20 on which part of the
35 22 is the total number of
16 24 sent out a press release
10 27 if the president decides to
118 21 of people who want to
18 28 former deputy chief of staff
7 16 may be seen in a
28 21 find out who did this
7 24 has already been used to
7 27 this kind of information is
8 25 in front of the drugstore
7 19 will you give it to
8 22 think we can get there
16 19 from the tip of his
6 25 but there was a different
8 25 from the world of science
7 21 the sweat on his face
7 24 the official line of the
11 19 she had grown up on
11 18 did you do that to
6 32 of developing an eating disorder
12 19 with a child who is
9 20 be sure of one thing
8 20 us for so many years
10 24 tyson is the director of
11 31 he knows the difference between
42 23 there were tears in her
6 21 the speed at which we
6 21 planning to do in the
7 21 because it was a huge
9 30 studies have found that people
6 26 in the heat of competition
6 18 on to the next day
7 21 should come up with a
6 28 coming together for a common
6 28 wanted to tell him something
6 23 her mind and decided to
6 24 was not something that i
6 27 on reader service card load
10 22 that three out of five
26 31 the lines of communication open
8 19 west at a time when
22 20 was going to stay in
37 21 kids under the age of
6 29 a slight improvement over the
15 18 you may need to be
9 22 if they know what they
7 21 i the only person who
6 20 to at least three of
22 22 lot of people say they
6 21 he pointed out that a
22 26 the president at the white
8 24 worked very hard to make
6 24 the soviet union and now
7 21 he had very little to
8 23 he seemed not to notice
11 25 than they ever had before
10 21 on the other side now
7 21 his best to avoid the
10 21 the only reason i can
9 21 and it really made me
14 20 and i asked her what
7 22 well have more on that
8 21 than do those who are
7 28 was abducted and murdered in
11 32 the palm beach county canvassing
9 24 of the search and rescue
8 22 as she peered into the
18 18 now you know why i
6 25 and the most important of
8 18 if i had more time
12 29 the united states after world
6 24 of the defense budget is
10 25 of those who have already
6 25 cats in the united states
6 25 in the bathroom right now
7 23 but he already knew the
7 24 so what are you thinking
7 22 me to do something for
7 18 to find a good job
7 22 only the first part of
25 23 the size of the average
7 20 be out of this world
6 20 and it has also been
9 26 the edge of the atmosphere
9 22 has not been ruled out
7 22 because we have to pay
12 30 stored in the refrigerator for
12 27 the music of other cultures
6 22 all the people she had
7 20 been able to get his
9 20 won five of the last
7 25 be a central component of
17 25 the united states faces a
7 26 conclusion on the basis of
16 28 what the vice president said
7 30 had belonged to my grandmother
135 18 a case in point is
14 22 because you have to go
7 21 she was going to quit
40 18 to see if they had
6 37 syndicated columnist with the scripps
7 31 was the most difficult decision
19 20 and a little of that
10 23 problem that we need to
27 23 plays into the hands of
15 23 and i knew exactly what
8 20 climb back up to the
8 22 to the people who come
6 22 feel that at this time
7 22 think were going to be
9 27 represent a majority of the
8 22 the collapse of a star
7 19 gon na do with that
12 26 the amount of water needed
6 30 have an opportunity to discuss
7 29 is a very controversial issue
6 22 to remember that we do
13 25 but before he could speak
19 17 i went out with a
11 22 given a chance to make
9 30 the logic of collective action
10 21 live in the west bank
6 28 said in an earlier interview
6 22 more in control of the
7 22 they are waiting to be

28 16 when i grow up i
11 16 so he took me to

8 22 you had the ability to

6 18 said it in so many
12 25 out of the police station
8 23 be able to defend their
207 17 to go down to the
27 22 some other part of the
18 21 are very proud of the
17 20 it might be hard for
8 20 i figured it must be
13 28 in the morning and afternoon
8 24 women who are victims of
7 21 will begin as soon as
29 36 and palestinian leader yasser arafat
6 23 to do these things that
7 21 the deaths of tens of

6 41 computer assisted career guidance systems
8 23 very gracious of you to
8 27 what changes should be made
8 25 and speak directly to the
10 27 iraq and the united nations
7 28 a variety of teaching styles
13 22 would be expected in a
6 26 cover of new york magazine
6 17 has yet to be put
6 23 and running out of time
6 18 we do not know him
22 20 that was done in the
6 36 plotting to overthrow the government
11 32 was national security adviser to
6 23 i saw you on television
20 20 it was made clear to
6 23 been to the post office
13 25 which means there will be
12 27 the physical aspects of the
7 31 companies around the world that
11 29 the positive aspects of their
1083 22 while at the same time
12 18 you can put in the
17 23 them to the point where
13 17 be as good as you
6 26 never going to forget that
9 20 going out in the sun
16 23 did the same thing when
9 22 it all begins with the
10 20 is a little piece of
8 25 europe to the middle east
6 19 back to the way you
29 20 been an awful lot of
6 19 if you give him the
6 26 the brady gun control bill
9 21 to feel the weight of
21 33 president and general manager for
6 24 on their quality of life
6 22 to speed on the latest
18 22 a dramatic rise in the
13 21 the next time he came
9 25 during the reading of the
21 20 you ever talk to him
6 20 are the first to see
13 29 question the integrity of the
9 25 his first season as coach
15 25 beat the egg whites until
12 22 so that they know that
13 24 floor of the living room
10 20 the end of the album
21 23 this is the opposite of
6 17 what i know in my
6 33 of the ukrainian popular movement
6 24 perhaps it was just that
6 24 is described as having a
9 18 with him in just a
11 28 the use of anabolic steroids
6 23 was only too willing to
6 19 time that we have a
6 21 man who was to become
8 16 to give us a few
10 20 all of this going on
7 19 so i was very happy
7 19 out of an alley and
113 20 to give you a chance
6 26 would come sooner or later
12 25 it is quite another thing
6 19 it does come with a
6 29 is clearly the most important
15 23 of what was then called
9 19 much of that do you
7 18 but this is a real
10 20 to do things to make
7 28 put them back together again
6 21 for a time in silence

6 21 we will see many more
7 20 they do not now have
8 17 was a boy who was
6 30 the office of federal contract
9 24 it like working with him
12 19 you going to get it
6 21 with the guy with the
6 30 the black struggle for freedom
8 21 will be done with the
7 19 and in the blink of
12 23 officer of the new york
7 20 saying that i am not

8 26 we are interested in items
7 19 as though he had to
6 19 get a real feel for
20 21 think you could do it
6 26 everything that we have to
15 25 bring large pot of salted
8 21 a slight angle to the
9 22 this was the period of

8 25 a big difference when you

11 24 the threat to the united
6 19 down on the town of

6 20 they are not for the

43 23 has played a major role
6 25 everything you want it to
7 21 my heart skips a beat

6 24 involved in any of these
6 22 have been all right if
9 19 a vice chair of the

7 22 and all she wanted was
7 23 first study of its kind
6 19 think he may be the
20 25 in the last two centuries
9 31 a press conference this morning
15 19 and you had no idea
11 27 know who the next president
18 19 hell out of the way
10 24 gay men and lesbians are
6 22 a class action suit in
8 25 greater than the value of

7 19 have to take a bath
8 32 survey conducted by the american
8 25 or anyone for that matter
18 23 question that has to be

8 25 but you know what happens
11 20 few years ago it was
14 21 how i feel about that

32 20 on either side of my
6 22 the problem was in the
10 26 great pleasure to have you
6 27 not to mention the millions
15 21 at least part of this
6 22 the trouble is that in
16 22 far from being able to

6 25 first of a new generation
9 19 they got to know me
23 17 as he led the way

27 18 at a lot of things
31 20 how do you cope with
6 23 and what he was looking
6 16 as a guide for a
10 18 can also be a sign
6 19 when he is about to

12 22 it will have an effect
17 19 i could tell he did
8 16 to run us out of
16 20 what we found in the
12 21 for those who seek to
6 19 we need to win this
12 18 to turn on and off
243 22 that one of the things
6 28 apparent lack of concern for
6 22 most of the other half
7 20 you were out of your
15 15 out to be a new
102 19 the back of a truck
46 23 many of the issues that
50 19 he held up his hand

6 28 fires burning out of control
9 17 in and out of one
11 22 new york or chicago or
15 22 to share some of their
14 19 time we got back to

21 22 to the way things were
10 28 he entered the united states
9 25 no expression on his face
8 22 that half of the women
13 27 it would be presumptuous to

17 21 that we have tried to
8 20 to hold the door for
47 20 the age of the child
8 18 want to do and the
16 23 because you can see the
6 26 the authors argue that the
12 23 to appear on the screen
6 23 is golden brown and the
6 22 the study is the first
6 22 in a way that everyone
42 21 for the office of the
7 24 given to people who have
17 24 the center of a national
8 32 he forced himself to concentrate
10 30 for giving me this opportunity
6 26 is that the government may
8 25 there was someone who had
9 24 for the sake of accuracy

12 38 the cuban american national foundation
9 26 same thing could happen to
20 26 of texas medical branch in

7 25 my suggestion is that you
6 19 in a moment to talk
6 16 is up to his old
56 27 the american people need to
6 23 laughed and said it was

7 17 it had to be just
51 21 to the problem of the
12 24 you think there would be
59 22 before he had a chance
7 18 it is then that we
12 24 who knows what she wants
9 22 has also given rise to
6 22 one of those people in
6 18 i knew what was in
22 22 in terms of its impact
15 17 a guy who grew up
7 24 i recognize you from the

6 21 of their own that can
7 25 only at certain times and
6 19 is not in their own
6 24 but no decision has been
14 19 it would be far too
35 28 would make it more difficult

7 17 been out of a job
52 26 is serving a life sentence
8 23 that i had something to
8 29 the board and chief executive
9 23 one of the obstacles to
7 21 be better if they did
11 16 i am afraid i am
25 21 to decide the fate of
8 18 to tell her what a
12 18 i had to learn the
14 20 if the people in the
6 22 but he never showed up
9 21 are not going to know
11 28 the experience of the people
12 20 not to let it happen
11 19 i was going to hurt
38 32 journal of research and practice
10 28 has been an important factor
12 19 no more than a foot
6 26 was difficult to deal with
7 17 i say it out loud
8 32 my children and my grandchildren
6 22 the next six years and
6 22 in all the people that
6 25 the beginnings of the war
11 30 in the transition to democracy
16 23 they were joined by the
6 20 over the helm of the
12 22 the edge of the cliffs
10 21 can teach them how to
8 23 with a touch of sarcasm
31 19 that we have on the
7 22 even better than it is
17 19 he says he hopes to
7 28 to improve the management of
9 22 to win the approval of
7 22 to retire in two years
14 25 you had to choose between
10 25 in the rearview mirror to
12 22 the auspices of the un
6 20 and now the state of
6 17 and he has to pay
9 20 it took him a second
11 23 is that there are still
6 23 knowing what to do when
7 31 that the government of pakistan
6 26 the president came up with
14 22 should be on the table
10 26 that it would be extremely
9 19 to lead a good life
44 23 of the last eight years
6 24 in what was apparently a
27 21 the speed of light is
7 29 you have reached the national
15 20 he was the first guy
8 18 goal is to end the
12 20 the red sox beat the
7 25 was still standing on the
7 19 and let us know how
9 22 at the mall of georgia
6 20 will know what it is
13 22 can be used instead of
8 20 right up to the door
7 22 all you could see were
7 22 and they ended up with
6 22 herself out of bed and
16 17 as if he had seen
8 20 me for a few minutes
8 21 making me feel like a
10 28 to serve the american people
8 16 so i do think it
6 22 into the dark world of
14 21 one thing that we can
18 20 when he was laid off
6 21 to explain all of the
13 17 it turn out to be
7 21 in getting out of the
6 27 large number of students in
25 29 clear from the beginning that
6 25 i think is more important
12 30 to say anything negative about
6 22 to do with the culture
7 22 it was clear then that
6 17 you get a new one
10 33 consortium of texas newspapers by
8 23 a long time between now
6 24 who was really in charge
15 20 over the years and i
6 25 from which it would never
7 17 to you is that we
11 28 and world headlines are next
11 28 the needs of gifted children
6 24 we can gain insight into
7 21 he wanted to kill her
13 31 the europeans and the americans
18 29 a lot of different directions
51 28 when you start talking about
39 18 in the wake of its
7 24 that she had no interest
15 19 but try as he might
6 19 going to be told to
14 30 the number of african american
13 20 life to the study of
7 28 majority of the iraqi people
6 23 so many other things on
30 20 to make their way to
7 25 lights blinked on and off
7 20 but they had to give
6 18 she is in her late
40 18 to the home of the
6 26 kitchen and made herself a
6 21 just to get them into
23 27 the los angeles dodgers and
31 20 it from the point of
12 18 not the time to do
9 18 he wanted us to do
6 18 as a reward to the
7 27 in offices around the world
7 18 for her to go home
23 19 and you can read an
8 24 the bride and groom have
7 19 go back to that day
11 18 get out of here as
6 21 to which i would like
12 22 pleasure to be able to
13 22 problem is that you do
23 18 got out of her car
8 29 you support the death penalty
33 25 from a political point of
8 25 not going to let anything
8 23 that we can do together
28 21 a greater role in the
6 19 we were a few years
11 22 we have so little time
6 24 and what they care about
12 18 on the first day i
7 16 it up and try to
21 22 it needs to be changed
6 23 as we talked about with
9 26 and quality of health care
13 23 is on the drawing board
9 23 her family that she was
24 20 all eyes were on the
6 22 some of the women have
30 18 if you want to eat
17 21 she gave him a little
54 19 to have been one of
6 18 he was at it again
38 27 at the federal reserve bank
9 23 part of your daily life
8 20 end of the line with
6 29 proportion of students in the
11 21 of this point of view
6 22 least for a short time
7 18 it was hard on her
10 21 the figure of a woman
19 22 the air force and navy
27 19 i would be the last
7 22 as the new year begins
10 23 you are really going to
6 30 with different kinds of people
43 22 about you all the time

6 19 and it was they who
7 19 that says a lot for
10 17 us what to do and
23 30 from the civil rights movement
7 19 it is governed by a
9 21 have to work two jobs
16 22 which is that there is
6 21 the four years that i
7 17 had to look at it
7 25 a minute had passed since
6 21 long as she could get
9 22 the death penalty in a
22 22 is going to be decided
93 20 the next step was to
9 21 he was struck down by
12 20 can be found in both
19 22 who said they had been
6 20 in the media is that
9 26 things began to fall apart
6 21 of the bishop and the
9 27 is a strong likelihood that
19 19 do not yet have the
6 18 turn it into a big
105 20 that there is no way
40 16 a lot of that in
9 21 decided not to take a
6 24 keep in mind that people
7 24 would have been great to
9 22 of the program was the
7 24 believe that if you want
12 18 out what we can do
6 25 i think it probably means
7 23 you never know how they

41 20 like that in my life
14 24 one of the worst moments
10 23 i grew up in california
10 21 going to happen to it
23 31 for this candidate was received

8 23 the very heart of their
6 28 two decades of experience in
7 30 the liberation tigers of tamil
9 20 you want me to think
6 24 and the free exercise of

6 20 no one had heard her
9 22 who won a bronze medal
8 22 through a lot of these
7 19 had been on her own

8 22 and as we were walking
6 21 the die has been cast
13 25 around long enough to see
9 20 but when you get the
6 16 so when i had to

6 20 what i was saying in
6 25 of making the decision to

6 26 and a national tv audience
6 23 i believe in the future

19 31 tablespoon oil over medium heat
8 19 you expect me to be
15 24 more closely tied to the
6 25 when i answered the phone
8 23 may well have been that

16 30 expansion of the united states
36 23 to bring up the subject
7 29 what is your greatest concern
7 24 that the ease with which
6 25 looks very similar to the
12 17 of my time on the

14 22 but i could still hear
6 19 you that all of the
12 25 research has been done in

11 19 i could see that my
8 19 in this case on the

25 19 and our way of life
110 14 if it is to be
7 21 from this is that the

10 19 now appears to be a
6 22 you think you could be
6 24 with the richness of the

16 16 what is he up to

8 23 the persian gulf war in

14 23 the age of the students
37 15 and as a way to

18 25 people out there who want
6 27 this is a fascinating story
10 23 be spending the rest of

22 20 why this is the case
10 33 the international society for the
7 23 i lived in an apartment

10 27 percent said they wanted to
6 23 going to come down here
16 24 setting the tone for the

10 22 the things that can go
32 20 up and looked at the
10 20 it can happen in the
6 23 climbing out of the car
6 25 to win a general election
6 21 were any of the other
13 21 the right spot at the
11 21 would go up in flames
14 17 not a lot you can
10 18 had a smile on her
6 20 think it was time to
6 20 it is the measure of
11 24 could be regarded as the
21 18 so when you have a
6 32 scale of creative attributes and
7 25 with the situation on the
9 23 is here with some great
6 21 able to pull this off
7 28 of the vitamins and minerals
8 26 during the four years that
6 21 would have seen to it
7 20 i have time to think
8 16 i was so sure of

7 21 table and a couple of
11 20 it can not have been
11 27 tell them what had happened
9 22 he would go along with
26 27 thought about the fact that
8 31 maybe there was something wrong
7 18 make sure i did it
6 23 leading into and out of
37 27 laying the groundwork for a
8 21 find out that she had
7 31 the indonesian island of flores
11 16 but i do need to
7 26 is reported now by terence
9 22 would like to see such
6 32 military action against iraq and
8 26 pilot holes for the screws
9 21 and there was quite a
7 22 perot is going to have
18 26 patterns of light and dark
11 21 i think the facts are
6 24 and some of the students
6 19 i think they did an
10 19 who come to see the
10 28 the treatment of people with
17 21 look what they did to
6 23 to find ways to prevent
114 21 spend a great deal of

69 22 both sides of the road
15 37 relationship between husband and wife
11 21 we think we know what
7 18 it is past time to
13 15 i guess it is a
6 20 think has to do with
22 22 to tell you about that
6 22 the day after the show
7 36 clinton has undermined the integrity
7 24 can be used to encourage
6 21 to class the next day
7 28 events that have taken place
6 21 years from now when i
11 17 her eyes as if to
12 25 for more than sixty years
10 20 in a more subtle way
6 28 out everything you can about
12 22 first of what would be
6 23 to both male and female
7 28 through the mechanism of the
35 17 you like to go to
14 21 just more than a year
17 19 as i have ever been
6 20 have yet to be tried
89 18 and so i think the
74 24 they were supposed to do
23 26 be published this month by
6 21 need to face the fact
9 18 come a time when i
13 18 seem to want to do
14 28 provide a starting point for
17 23 in both male and female
6 18 we were close to a
9 23 answer would have to be
9 21 as they appear in the
37 27 to understand the impact of
19 24 which are expected to be
6 20 what it claims to be
10 21 might be able to hear
14 25 of the united states code
6 22 will this be enough to
6 19 we have in the city
11 32 some differences between the two
6 25 the streets of the french
42 23 what i should have done
17 22 spent so much time and
8 19 of this seems to be
8 24 them to do whatever they
10 26 build a bridge between the
14 16 is laid out in a
11 19 good is it going to
6 25 those who suffer from the
49 18 all of the rest of
6 24 that brought me up short
8 17 up and put him in
6 25 would be very helpful for
6 29 characterized by a high level
6 18 to pick up more of
6 17 us to the case of
6 19 that the way we are
6 20 a lot about this and
14 18 on my knees in the
8 25 of the nation letters npr
7 22 was the next big thing
8 22 believe that all of us
8 22 said he would veto any

19 21 a few of our favorite
19 19 been hit by a truck
7 22 put them in the fridge
6 23 will be the last chance
7 19 a giant hole in the

29 16 as a new kind of
9 24 until they just begin to
23 22 the bill in the senate
11 21 that seems to have no
7 18 i have not read it
51 20 walk out of the room
6 17 do not go out and
6 21 he let his breath out
16 21 until they got to the

8 18 a lot of gray area
14 19 that was a very big

32 19 the side of the van
10 21 other end of the pool
9 23 and they are subject to
8 23 while there seems to be
6 27 have spent the last several
12 22 what was the mood like
6 25 for another minute or two
8 20 trying to do her job
11 18 to go to the grand
7 20 at the door and then
6 27 and there was a possibility
6 20 now and then to look
15 21 want to stay with the
7 21 africa is going to be
79 21 in the pockets of his
9 21 i am president of the
14 34 for national and community service
39 25 of public affairs for the
11 22 think he would like to
8 21 three boys and a girl
6 21 they know that he has
6 15 but if we go to
6 24 that would be a positive
94 26 still to come this morning
8 22 such as the absence of
13 17 would be out of a
50 22 to two years in prison
25 17 and i hope you do
13 28 had very little contact with
8 28 through what we went through
10 23 and at least four other
10 24 the door and stood there
8 20 approach is to use a
13 33 understanding of the evolution of
11 18 the use of the two
9 24 how much money should be
12 26 my head against the window
10 31 the opinions of the prospective
8 33 questionnaires were mailed to the
46 27 came to the same conclusion
14 26 thought that that would be
8 18 is a man who lives
14 20 you want your son to
7 22 then it must have been
60 28 a good relationship with the
6 27 beginning of my junior year
10 18 if you knew what i
14 23 to help defray the cost
13 18 be able to see any
11 20 had half the risk of
17 20 could be a factor in
6 18 by the kgb and the
9 24 comes once in a lifetime
33 22 and joining us here in
6 21 was a serious blow to
31 21 they are still in the
8 23 like to take our survey
10 24 think when we talk about
76 24 and the other thing that
116 30 online and again here tomorrow
33 20 no one would be able
19 16 to me that i did
22 21 the hell are we going
8 21 will serve as a basis
9 22 some day in the future
42 18 i found out it was
6 22 be the real reason for
13 25 i was also thinking about
12 28 wanted to participate in the
8 19 on this story as it
7 31 the presentation of the results
6 22 she told me later that
6 27 aidid and ali mahdi mohamed
7 21 herself in a way that
8 27 everything he could to keep
11 25 sit around and do nothing
8 20 was right next to me
9 19 but when i came out
48 22 country is going to be
10 29 ingredients in a large mixing
6 20 you most like to see
14 21 it would take time to
46 21 did not know was that
7 21 you look at the stats
6 25 do you think history will
7 33 the bush administration is taking
7 23 a bolt of lightning hit
21 18 me that i would be
7 22 think the best way for
7 25 that not much has changed
6 22 is no evidence for the
29 19 is a matter for the
7 20 that it was all part
7 20 or at least with the
44 20 has not been lost on
7 21 lot of people up here
9 26 been saying the same thing
6 24 was based largely on the
17 19 were able to make a
64 18 of his time in the
47 20 based on a series of
291 21 and some of the other
14 20 long way in the last
8 19 one on one with the
6 24 he took matters into his
7 27 the united states in august
10 22 that i wanted to bring
6 21 and the first ever to
11 23 like to see that happen
6 22 he has been around for
8 21 they would want to go
13 21 to me that there were
6 16 a fish on a line
7 19 in his hour of need
19 21 had to strain to hear
10 22 to change the rules on
16 21 for almost a year and
8 26 differences in the type of
13 24 been part of the process
12 28 we asked the participants to
8 15 he is sort of a
9 17 we need to know a
7 26 going to run into problems
6 20 long as you know the
23 22 but i still think that
9 19 the idea is to show
11 25 be an opportunity for the
6 32 counsel for the senate watergate
8 19 is still a place of
6 19 even if it did have
9 28 in the security council that
14 19 a tour of the white
7 21 that you can use them
6 19 and said he was the
7 24 long have you known this
8 19 to the house of his
13 18 done as good a job
10 26 of the older americans act
6 28 the people and their elected
69 16 a way to get out
16 21 there was a ripple of
8 22 to keep their jobs and
6 23 although he had no idea
9 24 in a capital murder case
44 21 to take care of these
16 23 you talked a little bit

30 18 at a young age and
6 26 thought he might have some
16 21 to be seen is whether

6 19 in which you try to
7 26 to be most appropriate for

6 34 studies reported in the literature
78 18 were on our way to
25 31 policy studies at the brookings
7 24 in the third quarter but
7 20 i just feel that the
6 22 these are what we call

6 26 at logan airport in boston
6 23 and the more likely the
7 24 reason to fear for their

9 31 about the possibility that this
58 26 anything else in the world
11 18 and ask him why he
6 17 need to come to a

6 17 i did not feel at

10 17 a lot of good and
7 22 begin to appear in the
6 18 on the way there i
8 25 is largely the product of

16 19 up in our next hour
8 25 the news of the shootings
10 21 for them to know that
7 25 said the president of the
64 27 when you were talking about

37 21 takes a little bit of
18 21 a chapter in the book
8 22 the aim of the current
24 15 all i had was a
6 21 is a whole lot easier
12 23 you would not have been
9 20 was a huge factor in

9 18 he went out to his
7 21 go out there and they
6 18 move was seen as a
10 19 as the absence of a

7 33 according to world bank estimates
6 22 it reduces the cost of
8 23 lot of people who could
13 23 he was talking about it
12 26 it made all the difference
6 24 should be covered by the
7 19 he was part of that
9 17 i know is that if
38 26 to take matters into their
9 21 because i did nt know
8 18 a point to talk to

7 19 got off to a strong
7 22 and spend the money on
8 24 of the contexts in which
6 23 you to tell me anything
14 23 this was in response to
9 18 which is to say in
17 34 relationship between the amount of
13 21 at the picture on the
7 21 and any other kind of
7 22 the reasons i think we
7 27 i will leave the republican
8 19 to wait for the bus
11 23 done for the benefit of
204 28 it is important to recognize
8 18 a man who had made
13 22 often take the form of
24 22 do you agree that this
13 23 middle of the table and
11 19 be what you want to
6 21 a product of his time
14 29 the most controversial of the
8 22 gotten in the habit of
6 28 of national security and the
9 19 in the west is that
9 26 i knew something about the
15 20 wanted to get on the
7 25 like a younger version of
26 27 the authors are grateful to
9 24 the kind of defense that
17 20 is that what i think
9 29 in both primary and secondary
16 23 it would be better than
7 37 consumer product safety commission is
36 18 to be sent back to
11 27 of the last eight elections
6 27 thought to be necessary for
14 27 bottom of a lightly greased
9 24 the president is the one
38 23 and i think that really
7 23 going to be critical in
6 24 but in the months before
8 19 tried to get up but
6 17 i sat alone in my
7 22 will be looking to see
6 24 one of the most relevant
21 23 fact that there were no
14 23 a deep breath to steady
6 21 know if she was still
8 22 it is widely held that
7 19 if we are forced to
22 18 in a case that has
11 28 a situation where people are
7 25 v board of education case
10 20 as well as they have
13 19 and i tell you that
10 16 done a heck of a
6 19 we can only do this
8 33 for cultural competence in social
6 25 who stands in the doorway
6 30 that the united states already
9 20 into the office of a
17 29 for the department of justice
12 21 and i think when they
9 23 some in the white house
6 20 her baby in her arms
7 17 by the name of mr
24 25 he realized that he could
8 24 an average of four years
6 23 to the inner surface of
7 21 in the world for that
6 21 had tears in our eyes
6 25 why was that so important
8 23 is it possible that our
8 17 to us that he had
14 18 in the old days he
15 30 weapons of mass destruction on
6 24 the most complete set of
6 23 were moving in the same
14 22 there was no word from
6 21 put an end to slavery
9 22 and how it has changed
7 28 eventually they will have to
8 26 we are dealing with people
7 22 wage the war on terror
9 23 games in the first half
7 21 to try to explain how
7 20 will have to be left
7 21 had slowed to a crawl
6 22 he was wrestled to the
12 22 has been more and more
7 20 few more days to get
18 25 of the population will be
9 23 the realm of the spirit
6 24 but the people are still
6 26 has a strong balance sheet
19 21 each of the last five
6 20 of the time of death
342 19 on this side of the
6 24 and i think the greatest
31 21 the aging of the baby
6 28 there are two major problems
6 24 you wonder what it would
32 19 a lot of women have
9 26 have to go through another
12 21 of the cities and the
6 28 reduce risk of heart disease
7 26 get through the front door
41 21 old man and the woman
9 24 the fact that they found

8 20 we will have to move

7 28 take much imagination to see
9 22 cause of his death was
19 24 kicked off her shoes and
56 21 he picks up the phone
27 25 never know what to expect
9 28 would never do anything that
65 24 the edge of the platform
7 21 it will take to reach
13 15 in the pan on a
60 22 to the manner in which
12 31 the monica lewinsky story broke
9 27 despite his best efforts to

11 25 the middle class is being

9 16 of it than it is
14 23 from his nose and mouth
8 22 rule with an iron hand
7 21 seems like a long way

12 22 that was a little more
12 22 had not seen her since
7 26 insight into what it means
9 21 the first time or the

8 22 the moral fiber of our

6 21 they had a problem in

7 20 this was not a woman
12 24 i know this is something
9 25 do you understand what it
9 22 effort to clean up the
27 21 can say what you want
8 19 i came back to work
7 22 especially if it was a
9 20 of the us embassy in

8 23 it might have been some
9 21 his first year out of

6 22 chance to do what they
31 20 just as long as they
6 19 who sat next to the

9 20 you look down at the

52 24 you have a better chance
40 20 it was too early for

6 25 attention can be given to

15 21 and there was a woman
6 21 safe to say that they
6 22 to scrape up the money
6 22 are going to hear more
11 24 and we have a tremendous
10 25 things going on out there
57 25 for any number of reasons
19 22 how much time it takes
34 22 to the south of france
6 22 that was the low point
6 21 at the stage where we
12 20 and in this way they
6 20 all the good it does
12 32 have to take some responsibility
10 19 sat next to him and
8 21 he ran his hand along
12 21 the start of the gulf
6 22 one of two states that
7 22 only after a period of
10 29 you right here tomorrow night
7 17 so i find it very
11 17 he let out a deep
20 16 on how to use it
16 23 the iraqis are going to
8 18 we did nt have any
19 29 the first meeting between the
79 23 with a group of friends

25 29 the vast majority of children
7 22 the only sound i heard
6 19 will have to pay to
6 24 how much money was spent
36 21 we can make sure that
19 19 and now that he was
12 23 could you talk a little
18 32 immigration in the united states
8 29 a spanish warrant for alleged
19 22 is a question that has
17 20 she gets to her feet
6 19 that we can be sure
6 20 trying to do is come
6 21 to wither on the vine
7 22 did they know and when
16 27 unthinkable a few years ago

21 16 as a man who has
6 29 challenges in the years ahead

6 24 i think that was because
21 25 between those who want to
7 19 it back to new york
14 23 can be a very effective
18 21 one has to wonder how
12 18 as if it should be

6 16 as the size of a
17 21 you in a little while
6 15 i got to get in
8 19 there is no fear of
6 21 is that in most cases
37 22 he seemed to be saying
24 17 but we want to be
29 26 within the next six months
25 23 when i think about what
11 24 realize that this is the
12 25 in terms of the potential
22 19 and what does it do
7 21 how will we ever know
10 16 i got a taste of
6 21 has been killed in an
11 23 at this time in history
15 19 to begin to look at
9 22 five to seven years to
9 19 to get worse as the
6 19 person i was when i
6 20 i could see the fear
13 21 that she was the most
9 24 they would have a better
7 19 i lost all track of
10 21 is no solution to the
9 23 tell you what was going
10 26 a peace treaty with jordan
7 18 so much as a child
24 21 it could also be that
19 20 deal with all of the

80 20 to set the stage for
10 24 the sale of the property

6 26 doing the same exact thing
6 31 most researchers agree that the

8 29 something that they wanted to
7 24 the changes under way in
9 27 you can without moving your
32 21 to bring to the table
13 18 but now that he is
7 23 i was the only american
35 20 a couple of weeks in
82 17 is that it can be
6 19 are you giving me a
19 18 it used to be said
6 17 easy way to get a
7 22 her father had gone to
7 19 you have to run for

7 26 whitney museum in new york
8 29 to changes in the environment
6 26 latin america and the rest
6 36 expressed do not necessarily reflect
10 24 that the problem lies in
12 21 have to be allowed to
7 19 sat for a while and
6 19 he went on to found
7 21 where we used to have
6 27 they see the handwriting on
6 19 he climbs up on the
6 26 in terms of the conditions
7 23 to convince him to stay
7 23 but the stakes are high
6 17 so far as she was
6 25 he apologized for what he

7 28 percent of the officer corps
15 24 according to the book of
8 22 house the night of the

10 21 and this time of year
7 20 of the identity of a

16 31 office of the inspector general
9 21 the lights are off in

19 24 most of these things are
7 17 to put up most of
7 20 the money out of his
7 18 in a room with two
6 29 it would make much difference
7 19 and is no longer in

64 20 we want to work with

8 24 the first thing we ought
9 27 rest of the world community

53 19 and as a result the
10 24 getting back on its feet
7 33 boston contributed to this report
8 21 the feet of those who

8 21 have a lot of success
19 24 a recent graduate of the

8 24 had fallen victim to the
23 21 jumping in and out of
7 23 looks down at his watch
6 22 been brought up on the
7 22 why i was so surprised
26 26 one of the main characters
7 20 have to just sort of
7 27 to the needs of individuals
13 24 there were lots of other
8 23 was passed by the house
7 20 then once in a while
6 21 and i believe in what
6 18 that i do not wish
10 23 question that i want to
12 28 placed within the context of
10 21 and a few other items
13 29 scholars have argued that the
13 19 a lack of access to
11 26 out through the front door
10 19 is this a sign that
7 27 of the investigation by the
7 26 is that the most effective
6 24 they had no problem with
58 23 kinds of things that we
8 21 if it is not possible
19 22 has long been known to
11 19 out of her head and
10 22 up until the very last
13 22 i really think that it
56 18 do you see this as
7 23 put them in position to
32 23 much to be thankful for
12 18 come to the top of
6 27 of the united nations which
32 19 the three of us sat
18 31 the direct and indirect effects
9 19 that was a waste of
7 20 space of a few hours
9 19 so what is the best
25 23 to listen to the people
7 25 sold tens of thousands of
7 23 exchange for the use of
7 24 a point where they could
6 34 the contradictions inherent in the
17 19 is a great tool for
8 20 made a lot of movies
10 23 a cocktail party at the
6 21 of nation we shall be
6 22 you look like a little
11 16 i do not find it
6 25 problem of whether or not
6 22 living for a long time
9 24 the best example of what
13 22 two or three months of
9 27 barksdale air force base in
13 30 believe everything you read in
8 21 loved the feel of the
6 18 be one of the keys
9 20 a boil and reduce to
10 22 than half of the state
6 21 had tried to tell her
53 19 on what it means to
7 20 on the first of june
11 18 that a man who had
12 18 i was in there for
6 26 only person charged in the
8 19 how were we to know
7 21 the side of his chair
19 22 the gaping hole in the
6 27 as the major determinant of
8 29 the time of the investigation
6 25 we told you about earlier
14 28 the economy out of recession
15 24 lot of people are making
6 16 get up and go in
7 20 as soon as they went
24 19 one day when he was
6 22 i shook hands with him
12 19 of art history as a

14 25 of the harmful effects of
6 21 see the colors of the
6 20 much more to be said
7 24 leader in the history of

6 15 him to do a lot
6 19 have to say to each
9 27 the fourth circuit court of
7 20 he took a drink from
9 25 was also president of the
8 25 are plenty of examples of
21 23 he thought he was being
8 25 after the other after the
8 18 not see the end of
111 23 a small group of people
21 20 and it was only then
10 21 get out of the saddle
6 17 a nice way to say
6 25 began to suggest that the
13 19 part of a series on
16 28 film written and directed by
15 22 some point in his life
13 20 at odds with that of
9 19 of which is that it
12 20 what do you think as
8 20 into the tops of the
6 19 just as the last of
14 18 was a crack in the
15 24 the back of the bathroom
6 18 he knew it was bad
10 18 and be able to pay
9 19 see over the top of
6 23 going to do that anyway
480 20 they will be able to
30 18 to make sure i got
6 22 i think the judge will
9 26 that nothing could be more
6 22 suggest to you that if

10 26 a different section of the
6 29 companies have been forced to
6 24 who would be offended by
7 24 series in the history of

16 22 a lack of support from
11 26 led the development of the
7 17 the same as for a
18 23 than they would have if
8 30 must do everything possible to
6 31 is significant not only because
6 19 we get that kind of
11 27 wanted to be somewhere else
17 22 george w bush is going
8 24 for the state of arizona
8 22 that there is no limit

25 18 not have much of a
13 25 not likely to be repeated
17 22 this is believed to be
6 17 but this may be a
24 19 to the logic of the
69 31 stolen from a residence entered
9 19 i could tell he had

15 27 please join me in welcoming
79 14 to do it is to
28 19 it when it comes to

9 21 was late at night and
9 21 wrote the book on the

9 20 i can deal with this
11 20 a great deal of care
11 19 we open the door to

7 20 who is going to want

13 25 be remembered as the year
9 16 of a lot of very
30 18 you may have to do
6 16 up and saw a man
6 28 good example of what happens
10 21 back down in front of
15 29 after the events of september
6 25 everyone has heard of the
6 18 i had come to hate
54 34 statistical package for the social
8 38 of the student nonviolent coordinating

7 21 trying to have it all

8 20 a picture of the man
8 26 neither the main effect of

8 25 think that you might have
6 28 think that most people would
10 37 the federal employees health benefits
7 22 borrow a page from the
7 27 they are closely related to
18 21 hang up the phone and
8 18 not feel a need to
6 24 when they are very young
27 18 act as if they are
25 29 the federal rules of evidence
16 22 that he has never been
7 19 to tie up the loose
9 22 i was young and stupid
6 20 him better than i do
11 19 out in the open air
16 19 at the moment i was
7 21 is a finite amount of
8 21 such as the desire to
6 24 why people would want to
7 16 to put that in a
26 24 seem to be interested in
13 24 thought there might be a
6 19 of the new state of

6 23 there are so many songs
18 23 his way of dealing with

9 18 have no idea if it
10 29 taking the necessary steps to
19 29 in the united states annually
16 24 with the way things were
7 18 goal is to be able
8 21 it first thing in the
12 22 she put down the phone
31 22 but there was no other
17 24 to invest in real estate
12 25 both join us this morning
6 17 was due to a lack
10 29 might be more appropriate for
9 23 spending a ton of money
15 24 well beyond the reach of
11 19 for the door of the
7 32 group had a significantly higher
8 21 have done such a good
8 17 you are not a man
14 17 and it is to this
25 20 i can not believe it
13 27 ask the right questions and
6 21 that in the next four
8 23 neither one of them has
9 23 the same people who did
15 24 that perhaps there was a
8 24 on the grounds they were
8 25 piece of cake compared to
8 23 my mother had taught me
10 20 they felt as if they
7 24 is very clear about what
9 21 he does not look like
57 26 take a rocket scientist to
7 22 of the role of science
6 20 was not a matter for
11 18 he died a few days
6 20 an idea that came to
6 23 and the value placed on
24 21 him to stay away from
6 27 murders of byrd and melanie
6 25 books and on the internet
98 19 this is the man who
6 34 of physical education teachers and
15 23 to do something for him
6 32 has expressed some concern about
7 19 i was going to beat
14 21 you ought to have the
36 15 a bit more of a
7 29 women of childbearing age and
7 27 to reduce the volatility of
10 23 i could have danced all
13 18 what if one of the
6 33 united states supreme court would
14 21 may be the reason why
7 21 came as a total shock
6 32 response scales will have higher
6 23 worked as an editor and
19 23 but the question is how
8 21 that there is such an
18 23 number of people who do
6 18 was tied up at the
10 21 know who was going to
21 29 amendment to ban gay marriage
24 22 she would no longer be

6 19 to fall on his face
14 19 you need to take to
10 18 her as a woman who
6 20 are going to learn a
6 20 thing is to have the

8 21 are you doing here so
10 26 that could not possibly be
13 19 to say there was no
18 24 we have the potential to
7 24 also comes into the game
7 23 to position itself as a
8 19 have i ever done to
8 25 why are you just standing
8 27 latin america and the world
11 26 that would otherwise go to
7 27 different areas of the city

6 24 would be wonderful if it
13 17 as if no one else
7 39 correspondent suzanne malveaux joins us
44 21 at the very time that
7 20 we have to find that

7 26 that he could not continue
6 19 if you never get to
8 24 the results of the group
12 29 of the most important sources
7 23 that you think that you
21 21 who has been known to

9 27 makes it impossible for him
16 21 sit down with him and
38 22 looked up and saw that
7 24 he was scheduled to meet

10 19 has been an area of
6 22 one of those young men

10 19 to take a page from

8 18 out of the wall of

7 20 the effect is one of
17 26 the attitude of the people
9 29 complained that they were not

7 18 me out in front of
9 17 i have to get her
6 19 off the deck of the

41 21 the only one who does
6 25 change in the first place
8 29 with his understanding of the
9 20 can we do this again
6 26 that are completely out of
9 16 is a big step up
103 19 it comes down to it
36 27 that there is a possibility
10 24 things having to do with
10 20 for a moment the two
20 16 a cup of hot tea
6 32 protections in the united states
18 28 and their perceptions of the

6 23 who could blame her for
8 31 assistance of the united states
56 19 is not good for the
13 16 so how did he do
8 23 was back in the kitchen
13 22 there was always a lot
7 27 likely to be very different
14 19 when you add it all
6 17 once i was out of
8 20 would be left out of
9 21 back to the office in
9 20 one of the very last
6 19 is only going to go
7 26 of desperation on the part

37 20 but it might as well
12 19 got ta take care of
11 19 it at some point in
13 22 i think both sides are
12 20 and took a long look
7 18 say is that it was
60 19 you and i have been
25 18 i was hoping for a
7 20 stood in a long line
49 18 is all the time we
38 20 of the things you do
17 20 but this is a little
6 20 and no one is saying
7 33 of early southern decorative arts
7 20 never get rid of the
6 22 piece of the puzzle to
6 20 of having to rely on
7 20 as if these were the
7 18 us that we are all
48 17 i thought i saw a
14 21 i think that in terms
16 18 the eve of the new
7 22 the due process of law
6 19 them how to do this
14 19 i tried to call you
11 23 do whatever you need to
11 23 before they even got to
20 18 held up a hand and
9 22 whether there can be a
12 23 can also be observed in
7 24 most of what they wanted
6 25 and the screen went blank
7 20 must be added to the
8 22 reminded me of all the
7 27 latest from the white house
7 22 in the face of poverty
8 24 this as the beginning of

39 21 in which there are no
9 23 there is a thing called
6 17 at all as long as
13 28 really none of your business
15 25 are more things in heaven
6 21 know where to turn to
14 23 that they are not doing
45 25 i would never do anything
6 26 of the proudest moments of
7 21 if they knew that the
13 24 able to stay in business
9 22 made up of hundreds of
20 23 was silence in the room
11 24 that the likelihood of a
15 26 he immersed himself in the
8 28 convenience of not having to
7 21 be able to select the
8 27 for diversity and ethics in
13 22 just a little piece of
7 26 it must have been terrible
10 24 stood up and walked away
25 22 just trying to make it

6 23 years in prison on each
15 20 we get the latest on
32 23 and she closed her eyes
9 22 the only place that we
7 21 years of service as a

7 21 by most of the people
7 24 you could have taken the

6 26 any member of congress who
6 20 the money to buy her

10 20 sad look on his face
16 21 what we decided to do
6 22 i know that there will

6 25 in saudi arabia last week
21 25 more likely to be married
16 21 by the ability of the
114 23 a senior in high school
39 20 what would i do with
10 23 extent to which each of
43 18 just as soon as we
35 21 in the year since the
15 16 put a sock in it
29 20 it makes sense to me
17 24 worked seven days a week
9 22 wanted no part of this
6 20 to keep on trying to
16 15 we had a lot in
11 19 so we know that the
26 21 for the origin of the
7 26 eat at least five servings
10 20 we ought to let them
14 22 not be denied that the
6 16 and we are not a
20 30 miles from the canadian border
19 16 of one or two of
17 20 and you can see them
11 21 you going to find the
14 20 the rest of the unit
11 19 may still be in the
129 24 in the last three months
9 23 military and the use of

20 19 of the few people i
6 23 money in a bank account
9 20 with the edge of her
9 19 women in a way that
6 19 made in the heat of
85 20 one does not have to
6 28 interesting to me about this
39 24 wake up the next morning
175 20 a few years ago when
11 22 to do so would require
14 24 of the subject matter of
10 25 has the burden of proving
6 21 human race as a whole
7 19 would you tell us a
12 20 back to the here and
6 29 this seems to be particularly
15 24 at the same time keeping
9 25 of the next several years
6 30 send american ground troops to
6 16 to be free of it
14 22 she joined us from her
13 25 saudi arabia and the gulf
9 25 be pointed out that there
7 31 the issue of immigration reform
7 19 she was a symbol of
10 20 he had taken care of
31 22 three of the past four
7 27 you have to have confidence
58 21 on the faculty of the
8 30 most significant aspect of the
11 26 through the eyes of others
6 21 can be on the lookout
28 21 a part of our culture
57 20 of some of the other
9 27 doa regina ortega de carlos
7 20 for years to get the
6 23 one of the men arrested
53 23 over at the white house
6 34 her sexual harassment suit against
7 20 only in the long run
12 22 right in the front row
27 19 how is she going to
22 28 the medical use of marijuana
6 19 now than i ever did
9 26 is the one responsible for
7 23 thought he was a really
9 16 in the rear of a
17 26 think this is an important
9 22 look at what is coming
19 20 to the cheers of the
23 18 one has a right to
8 23 much more likely to say
16 18 pick him up at the
25 23 it should have been the
42 26 you have to have something
11 21 as a means to improve
12 28 there was nothing to prevent
11 22 the one thing he could
7 21 know what he had done
22 17 be a part of what
12 24 there is any doubt about
6 20 but even that is not
6 18 not so much for me
6 24 about the parable of the
8 28 it is the most comprehensive
14 25 commander of us forces in
10 22 the only school in the
11 18 are just a part of
6 31 candidates for president in the
9 20 of the big ten title
6 23 i thought about the way
15 17 us up to speed on
9 22 best to stay away from
23 17 to a woman who is
15 26 most beautiful city in the
11 21 the real story is the
7 21 feet off the desk and
11 18 park at the end of
62 18 that he would be a
6 21 his way of looking at
9 29 copy of the birth certificate
8 17 it has to be able
7 19 had a sense that he
6 20 i think one of those
7 18 was so proud of me
50 17 i felt a sense of
7 19 him to the new york
8 21 who happens to be his
8 21 back to her house and
8 20 be able to give that
6 21 afraid that if he did
6 18 not put off by the
6 24 in the way they approach
6 26 are you guys talking about
27 20 a very good year for
10 38 mental retardation and substance abuse
6 23 about what we have been
31 22 not going to back down
7 25 stay up all night talking
9 27 through the windows and the
8 22 at this point it seems
15 24 to support them in their
6 26 him from the vets hospital
7 20 tell them that it is
13 20 the things that i am
6 27 her car was found abandoned
9 19 made a point not to
8 25 recognize that this is an
6 24 has been used to address
7 15 he is a sort of
8 31 refused the plane permission to
15 22 to the rhetoric of the
9 21 you and i are sitting
15 21 then he turned to his
15 18 i could do to make
9 27 a growing number of workers
18 25 understand that it is not
6 25 going to be awhile before
6 19 it was a great move
16 28 to death by lethal injection
33 17 in the world as a
7 16 it the way i see
10 18 if you were out of
7 22 then that this was the
7 17 is how i ended up
34 20 just want to let you
12 21 do you think we would
8 22 not know where to turn
35 22 are going to come from
6 22 concern that i have is
8 20 at the time it would
6 28 little help from our friends
33 19 i needed to talk to
8 24 she started to walk away
7 23 felt the tension in his
11 28 is a distinction between the
6 19 in the success of a
6 24 the world of fashion and
6 24 to develop a theory that
9 30 the situation is under control
15 20 can be the basis for
9 23 are two or three things
8 15 in my mind as a
8 22 to the funeral home to
51 23 of coming to terms with
6 28 have to do everything myself
9 23 a turning away from the
13 25 for the los angeles daily
17 19 have been seen as a
9 18 what i did for the
7 23 one of those things for
8 20 know that he will be
21 19 to turn back to the
10 22 pulled out a knife and
15 20 i think it was wrong
11 20 and then do it again
37 19 we have to face the
22 19 is at stake here is
140 21 with some of the most
17 19 many of the men and
6 20 in their half of the
6 29 other republics in the soviet
9 18 we have to come in
9 23 pride in their work and
10 21 they stop in front of
10 23 with anyone else in the
13 32 in the american jewish community
23 20 when you look at his
9 26 were just talking about it
11 18 i think i made the
6 19 to look at the very
12 25 billion over the next six
6 17 is an old man who
7 26 who happened to be passing
8 28 and then something like this
10 23 falls far short of what
6 24 of the house through the
14 24 look at the pictures and
7 22 to serve in the united
43 24 but the real question is
6 27 was a representative of the
15 25 people used to talk about
6 20 a little clip of the
6 19 to try to calm down
10 21 it took him two years
11 22 rest of the world have
158 18 i would like to do
8 21 would have done it if
7 18 is it more or less
13 22 that look on your face
7 29 of all nursing home residents
6 21 actor for his role as
8 23 it took about two years
7 20 i always feel that i
7 29 of the american medical women
7 18 a seat at the back
9 20 will be a lot better
6 20 like to tell me what
9 19 at the same rate of
16 18 that used to be on
6 21 reminder to all of us
8 27 includes but is not limited
16 18 we will try to get
7 28 that happens more often than
15 22 do you remember what i
6 20 maybe we ought to go
12 25 the data collected by the
8 20 would like to see my
7 19 in the ability of a
7 24 of a new political party
18 23 are the sorts of things
7 20 do you think is your
6 21 does nt mean that the
8 31 i was pleasantly surprised when
7 22 thought it was a prank
7 27 trying to sell me something
11 21 be able to find their
6 21 the one who had found
6 18 the day he got the
6 26 every dollar earned by men
6 21 to those caught up in
6 31 of journalism at the university
39 20 a group of more than
11 22 says more than half of
6 27 smartest person in the room
25 18 know that he was a
10 21 time now to head over
15 22 in the use of language
7 20 that he was too busy
9 25 is the start of something
6 21 main thing is that we
9 18 when you ask for a
17 26 have dropped out of school
9 23 and we would talk about
30 28 the most difficult aspect of
12 19 until i came to the
21 22 just tell me one thing
7 29 three words that describe him
6 21 and i will never know
7 19 and she has been in
9 25 to hear people talk about
9 24 the professor from up at
16 20 is it supposed to be
6 21 learn not only how to
18 18 what was in it for
6 25 always there when she was
9 27 the fiscal year ending sept
13 19 that by the time of
18 27 other sources of error into
15 26 authorized to speak to the
10 24 will be available to you
45 21 there was a change in
21 23 to change the world and
10 26 the perfect example of the
6 21 it does not matter to
6 20 out the worst of the
6 20 you want us to leave
8 21 does not give you the
6 21 have gone to new york
13 24 it has always been there
11 21 they are faced with a
49 25 is especially true in the
14 35 respect to the relationship between
6 26 a billion dollars from the
11 19 the way it is going
28 21 the point of having a
6 18 up and threw it at
13 24 to file a complaint with
6 20 have yet to hear any
8 21 a body had been found
8 22 have too much at stake

10 17 and i had to pick
25 21 you can expect to pay
6 23 was not allowed to take
6 24 and we now continue with
6 22 go through it one more
58 25 from the united states in
25 20 as a teenager in the
12 26 are you talking about that
7 21 was meant to be funny

27 18 take a look at him
14 17 down on top of me
8 21 to the very marrow of
13 21 and those are some of
6 25 you know exactly how much
6 29 to work more effectively with
11 21 needs a great deal of
9 23 we knew they were going
18 26 could not believe that the
16 20 has made the most of
14 22 than they do about the
10 26 that canada and the united
8 21 is kind of like being
11 22 from which most of the
7 28 said monday that the average
8 40 of bilingual teacher responses regarding

7 24 is going to change their
8 29 they could change their minds
6 26 away from the world series

7 20 made it clear in the
18 19 we all know that it
10 21 he knew himself to be
13 20 we always have to be
7 21 and he turned it down
29 21 when did you know you
6 34 veterans from iraq and afghanistan
21 27 the basic principles of the

8 20 well do you know the
7 20 do you have a reason
6 21 career as a member of

16 20 of course it was the
6 33 the provincial government and the
6 18 but once i got the
7 22 have had over the past
11 23 the threat they pose to
10 22 is in response to your

9 22 the same on both sides
8 18 option is to use a
6 30 emissions of carbon dioxide by

9 25 crme frache or sour cream
10 21 and opened one of the
7 19 what is the mood in
6 24 who could object to that
6 16 then it is not a
24 31 council on foreign relations in
6 20 put an arm around me
12 18 i sat in the front
6 27 a large number of civilians
6 23 going to be speaking at
11 22 we have a system where
7 22 had won the support of
6 21 a lot of evidence for
13 23 as the secretary of the

7 19 hands in the air as
6 26 in the business of running
6 30 afford them the opportunity to
7 28 i really appreciate the fact
9 23 inner part of the solar
9 20 levels by the end of
11 22 the last time we heard
14 23 spend some time with me
17 24 that suggests to me that
20 19 it was on the front
10 24 the fate of the universe
8 23 can with what they have
6 26 it was fairly obvious that
9 19 can not be the same
7 19 it is well that war
8 28 that slightly more than half
23 22 does it take to change
20 27 kwame holman has our report
42 19 is clear to me that
7 25 confused by the fact that
20 20 one way in which the
8 20 used to come up with
7 21 twice the cost of the
9 25 has been saying for years
6 22 could look at that and
6 23 involved in any of that
11 20 to the couch and sat
12 17 this and a lot of
6 35 with and without sexual dysfunction
6 27 that some people are saying
8 21 with the grain of the
50 21 i think the public is
9 22 think at this point in
8 20 let me give you this
7 21 her face that she was
18 24 part of the modern world
7 24 referring to is the fact
34 25 the causes and effects of

6 23 that he was coming back
6 22 to sign up for another
6 24 got married and had kids
24 19 have yet to see the
8 23 that from the bottom of
8 20 my goal is to create
6 24 and to the outside world
18 22 of the policies of the
21 21 think there is a very
7 25 a significant step in the
6 22 going to end up losing
13 17 we have to see if
7 20 can be viewed from a
91 23 would be willing to pay
49 18 that as long as we

9 26 the people who have worked
7 21 hardly get out of bed
6 26 as the final resting place
14 24 is that what happened to
11 18 was the guy in the

9 26 the size of the department
6 28 never seen a situation where
9 27 have been introduced in the

11 24 a look over his shoulder
7 24 in the situation that we

6 21 seems to feel that he
106 21 the first few days of

7 20 be fair to the other
7 23 it is only through this
7 25 to jump to the conclusion
8 21 so much over the past
6 22 in the drawing room at
6 24 and then wonder why they
8 23 that the state would be
7 23 proved to be a powerful
40 22 there came a time when

44 21 around the world in a
7 24 number of homes for sale
9 19 it all the way home
7 24 he said that even though
10 20 seemed as if she had
11 16 a rise out of me
6 25 but i know the difference
15 22 only in the absence of
7 26 by the chamber of commerce
8 25 points out that while the
7 21 even if the victim is

6 20 and now you know the
20 25 there is a very important
71 23 in the same position as
9 18 let them go to the
6 22 he started to read the
17 21 i thought i heard him
9 25 bill clinton and his wife
6 21 to offer a full range
6 24 studies have shown to be
12 20 in the past had been
13 20 a man who knows what
6 24 that can be put together
9 23 was out there trying to
15 18 to come up and say

8 24 that for all intents and
7 29 because they were believed to
36 21 the ground floor of a
6 24 of the arguments for and
7 22 best that can be hoped
9 18 one of the pair of
8 22 much like those in the
8 21 out in the woods with
9 20 he really did have a
6 27 to hear from the candidates
7 17 we be able to get
35 26 where the vast majority of
12 17 good to be on the
12 20 is the theme of this
6 25 the arts and the national
11 21 seems to be the point
8 18 i just tell them i
9 22 the truth is that both
12 27 to stop that from happening
7 22 on the cold tile floor
10 23 you telling me all this
66 19 i had to admit that
6 23 an economic shot in the

7 23 to cite but one example
8 16 we had no one to

10 23 as the central focus of
9 25 been together for so long
15 21 can think of only one
13 23 if you would rather not
7 20 it just struck me as
6 28 points and nine rebounds for
36 18 we go to the break
9 19 any of the things i
116 22 the fact that this was
10 22 saying is that we have

11 21 is easier for them to
10 21 hard to tell how much
11 24 role of government is to
6 24 to the moral high ground
6 23 nearly all of the first
8 19 a lot over the past
10 27 made the biggest mistake of
7 19 that many of us who

12 16 she has to do to
33 16 we need a lot of
6 20 half the time he was
21 19 not as much as they
8 28 based on the latest research
7 19 as long ago as last
27 24 the quality of the water
38 24 with a pastry blender or
11 23 and things like that in
7 25 two years and four months
6 20 a look ahead at what
7 19 to what will be the

19 27 sit down with the president
9 21 waiting for me by the

39 21 to the world that the
17 27 address the question of the
10 23 feel sorry for the poor
7 23 you said that they were
7 23 not even looking at the
6 21 are allowed to take a
8 19 but in so many ways
54 19 it was like a dream
8 22 share of the burden of
24 24 it is useful to consider
8 28 real difference in the world
31 22 to anyone who wants to
8 21 a tough time with the
8 23 that was a violation of
7 23 to find his way through
7 25 the second segment of the

12 20 not been lost on the
7 27 american people ought to be
8 23 which there is no known
21 28 on outdoors with mike norris
42 21 going to stand up and
11 15 as they do in a
22 19 time to get to work
10 22 and the next minute he
6 26 that at the very beginning
17 22 makes it easier for me
23 21 to the decline of the
9 20 what you know of the

6 23 and i thought it looked
15 30 the sloan school of management
48 23 figured out how to make
96 24 the only problem is that
23 23 based on the success of

8 23 get the country back on
7 35 civilization can not tolerate their
6 24 light of the morning sun
7 18 and i still had no
9 24 for the damage caused by
23 22 signed into law by the
6 20 the idea in his head
11 18 of law at new york
12 25 what has been referred to
26 24 know what will happen to
13 25 coincided with the end of
6 35 than for the disliking relationship
7 20 of sweat on his brow
12 21 more than a little of
6 19 to go into town and
6 16 for a time i was
15 20 and i think if there

8 24 it was a continuation of

6 25 party for another term as
9 20 nothing he can do to
11 23 finish in the top three
7 19 my first day at the
12 18 what so many of us
7 26 the situation is much more
7 26 a look passed between them
100 26 we have to understand that
6 20 that had been at the
16 34 attorney general john ashcroft and
11 24 this is definitely not a
53 27 it is unrealistic to expect
12 20 who went to work for
10 22 the tug of war between
17 21 every now and then it
18 26 this is precisely the kind
7 36 most influential athletic role model
15 18 as i could make it
21 16 and a half to go
8 24 does this mean that they
8 21 there was a big fight
8 36 of national unity and reconciliation
6 19 if all this is true
20 25 that more than one person
8 30 during the years that followed
25 26 everybody is going to have
736 18 a lot of people do
8 25 may be at least partially
26 26 the united states and from

6 28 to save for their retirement
15 23 wait until the next day
11 29 some of the more conservative
7 31 analysis was conducted with the
15 20 maybe it was the way
9 24 and doing the same thing
81 30 united states and the european
6 20 lever on the side of
7 21 the only ones in this
23 19 yes yes yes yes yes
11 21 and the two other men

10 17 i saw in his eyes
10 39 coalition provisional authority in iraq
19 27 the largest number of seats
10 20 so this is not going
151 25 i think the united states
6 22 points out that if the

9 24 join the live chat right
8 29 very beginning of this crisis
12 24 that the findings of the

25 24 of europe and the united
49 14 i have to be a
20 26 everybody else is going to

6 23 the leader in the field
12 20 and the need to keep
12 21 this can only be done
11 23 and to think about what
9 16 like a fish on a

8 22 let me take a question
7 23 in the largest sense of
7 25 has gone on the offensive
6 27 wooden table in the kitchen
21 21 the last phase of the

6 19 a house on the edge
40 21 give you a little bit
9 26 pay much attention to what
6 19 to get the banks to
15 20 is part of the point
7 22 laid the basis for the
8 19 trip to new york to
10 21 it has been trying to

7 19 and my father had a
17 24 and then the whole thing
11 20 had no idea just how
18 21 it had been since the
25 21 i never got around to
23 22 when i asked about the
9 19 do that to me again
9 31 to put distance between himself
8 31 health and human development in
155 22 the foot of the stairs
10 18 is that it is just
21 22 it was worse than that
13 28 he had more important things
7 22 is just about the same
15 26 favor of the united states
32 18 of what to do next
7 22 i just have to believe
14 27 elvis has left the building
9 23 he wanted to wait until
6 19 we do not know when
6 30 the americas and the caribbean

29 17 if we can make it
6 16 in a car that is
7 20 but when you get out
6 27 unhappy with the way things
36 15 to him as if he
7 22 that they do have some
33 21 a little bit from the
11 23 looks like a movie star
7 26 work for the phone company
11 24 he had been listening to
8 24 when you were little and
6 20 there was a quote in

23 15 and i was in my
24 24 to prepare for the worst
6 20 does it occur to you
7 24 it seemed that no matter
7 19 the beach or in the
18 22 from one of the nation
6 26 been edited for length and
8 21 what it takes to pull

9 22 in which case it would
70 20 that we have in this
6 27 blood where there should be
7 23 would you please let me
7 20 had to know what was

6 21 now on the market for
101 23 be back with more right
22 18 for him to go back

30 25 i look forward to hearing
17 31 school counselors in this study
12 24 still keep in touch with
45 30 with a better understanding of
8 25 i think both parties have
18 22 being caught up in the
8 16 a new look and a
7 18 be able to find at
7 22 wait until you see how
30 23 knocking on the door of
26 25 can you think of anything
7 25 a fire that destroyed the
12 20 lit up the night sky
10 20 much of what went on
9 26 other people out there who
8 19 can afford to do so
11 30 percent increase over the same
10 20 if you look into the
6 23 no longer has the power
14 19 a hurry to get back
7 23 those who said they had
11 28 announced that we were going
6 26 a computer terminal in the
8 18 he was on the last
8 19 not the first to do
7 18 i wish i was still
8 15 he is kind of a
6 16 the two men in a
9 19 she was ready to do
69 24 what they were doing was
6 25 through a window into the
8 25 knowing what i know about
7 22 deficit in half by the
9 19 how to get it right
7 20 to be the undoing of
6 17 to keep him for a
7 27 was supposed to get married
10 25 had absolutely no idea of
9 26 in a large midwestern city
6 20 it has a huge impact
6 25 it is possible to produce
11 25 there anything i could do
17 27 are walking down the street
20 18 so we have to look
22 22 how could you say that
10 20 one side of his head
10 27 was coming home from school
7 26 it was not appropriate for
64 17 we ought to do it
6 20 and if he decides to
12 32 first place the natchez democrat
6 21 we have found that in
12 18 so how long do you
7 21 on this issue as well
6 25 on the story of president
6 22 unable to find a place
20 27 and the introduction of the
7 18 as soon as i leave
15 25 could not be persuaded to
16 33 executive director of the chicago
15 17 time to let go of
13 27 the creature from the black
15 22 tend to be higher than
6 22 made over the years to
6 23 our guest is mel gibson
8 23 rights and the right to
7 18 had led her to the
6 24 going to agree with that
7 20 rest of the week was
7 27 our money editor john stehr
42 19 as far as they were
7 28 he found himself standing on
9 18 what i say is that
25 18 have a lot of kids
6 27 recent years they have been
6 18 i know what it can
6 28 of stress among lecturers in
33 21 playing a role in the
10 26 somewhere at the bottom of
42 23 that they are unable to
9 20 so when you say that
18 23 much to learn about the
13 20 have done so much to
7 21 about the hole in the
6 25 the needs of this country
7 19 milk and bring to a
16 28 just outside the city limits
7 27 the intersection of art and
8 22 the people that he was
6 25 down the hill through the
16 19 to be the model for
14 26 to the war crimes tribunal
12 23 world on the other side
15 20 i think we can agree
17 21 what are you doing at
6 22 he was beaten to death
10 24 the big question here is
10 25 he walks through the door
8 19 liked to have had a
15 19 the way back in the
15 21 are we going to allow
7 28 government is to protect the
7 31 overwhelmed by the sheer number
7 20 they do all sorts of
7 29 in the bush administration to
7 29 had to answer questions about
14 21 the role it played in
12 23 a member of congress to
6 23 at the london office of
9 18 a few of them even
7 26 over a sustained period of
10 21 they were made in the
17 19 it had come to this
7 22 a time when our nation
6 23 think the only way that
8 21 not been able to talk
7 26 he looked like someone who
7 19 had to make his way
7 32 is the former executive director
8 25 followed him out into the
8 22 but she was willing to
26 21 who are willing to do
8 21 think you need to see
11 22 to play fast and loose
8 19 want to take him to
16 27 and i understand that there
8 20 may be some truth in
16 22 you were going to lose
14 19 do not have to take
6 20 which i had grown up
8 18 to you is going to
6 29 in a significant reduction in
6 18 i gave him a piece
6 26 to inform consumers of the
6 29 increases the likelihood of a
10 20 where you want me to
6 24 may be at a disadvantage
6 16 a way i think it
22 22 years of hard work and
20 27 by the increasing number of

9 21 is nothing for it but
21 21 to the ground and the

48 23 like the right thing to
7 29 who are responsible for these
49 18 rise to the top of
6 22 for george bush in the
15 21 the north of the city
6 20 yet to catch up with
12 20 of them appear to be
6 29 eternal generation of the son
15 21 for him to talk about
10 20 not even aware of it
8 34 the answering machine was blinking
18 19 like the back of my
9 19 the power is in the

12 22 about it in the papers
8 23 mostly in the south and
20 18 put a good face on
6 24 perhaps by the fact that
7 26 united states has ever had
6 27 for the united states would
8 20 the time he left for
6 22 all of these items are
14 20 you have to be crazy
6 19 to die in order for
6 21 out from the crowd of
6 17 the old idea of a
6 19 and see if they are
9 19 of any one of those
8 21 come in every day and
33 24 the past decade has been
30 21 but he was willing to
6 25 not tolerate this kind of
6 23 more than their home is
38 19 to show that it was
7 21 made in the past year
17 24 that there were very few
7 25 have a high potential for

6 17 a key into a lock

6 19 a decade ago by the
6 18 but i did not kill
7 30 it is not surprising therefore
31 25 his head back and laughed
31 23 my first impulse was to
11 28 this could not have happened
7 23 try to determine if the
7 18 but not so easy to
13 19 to build a model of
8 22 with the first lady of
6 21 mind the fact that he
15 18 and he had told me
6 22 and you would say that
21 25 never thought i would see
16 25 it is not surprising then
10 22 are those who will say
6 18 men and women at a

13 29 the nineteenth century to the
31 25 boil in a medium saucepan
11 29 question is no longer whether
7 28 the anger and frustration of
17 21 his decision to go to
6 23 about the value of life
8 23 what looked like a very
11 22 hole in the ground and

25 26 the beginning of the class
6 17 a look at the day
16 26 in their perception of the

6 18 not for me to tell
6 20 and al qaeda in iraq
8 26 seemed as though they were
8 22 did not have a history
7 23 i was introduced to him
6 21 to your question is i
19 24 of the nonmedical use of
7 29 to understand that the united
6 25 tried to kill herself and
6 26 of research has focused on
10 26 term limits for members of
6 27 the middle and high schools
9 23 they had been taught to
18 24 if they want to continue
19 20 you can see how much
8 28 freedom of expression in the
9 26 she rolled down her window
13 23 she wished that she had
53 18 it is true that in
33 22 would have to take the
7 21 their man of the year
7 23 almost as often as they
28 22 at the local and state
7 20 i think we might see
29 30 a few hundred thousand dollars
8 21 the leader of a local
173 35 of the american medical association
21 28 spend billions of dollars to
18 22 in the history of rock
20 21 are people who have a
14 25 going to say something to
25 23 shut the door behind me
11 24 out in the community and
9 17 as much out of it
23 22 they might not want to
13 27 from one program to another
13 30 people from across the country
7 34 a national oceanic and atmospheric
8 20 going to want to buy
6 22 to the kitchen and the
6 33 the independent variables used in
6 30 the possibility of getting the
11 35 these were among incidents reported
27 24 a large portion of their
10 20 this is the issue of
17 27 have a working knowledge of
6 23 are no words to express
6 18 so i think what he
7 23 have the side effect of
9 27 reductions in the amount of
8 20 can you show me what
10 26 matter where it comes from
15 22 would like you to come
11 28 of participants in the study
6 20 a way for the united
14 27 if anything happened to him
8 24 they thought they had to
9 24 of higher education as a
12 23 opened the back door of
8 21 it seemed a long time
8 39 and immigration and customs enforcement
14 29 of the most controversial and
43 23 would have been just as
7 27 at the north carolina state
6 32 agreement with canada and mexico
8 22 way things are done in
6 20 is some truth in the
9 23 think of when they hear
13 22 has also been known to
25 16 to do when i was
9 28 glancing around to make sure
6 23 keeping an open mind to
6 34 state department of human services
8 19 as a resource to be
13 21 is starting to look a
8 22 have been treated as a
22 20 so i thought i would
6 21 again and again in my
9 19 of the party of the
7 30 the character of the president
29 18 i do not believe i
7 27 talk about the politics and
6 30 the discussion in this article
7 27 many people as possible and
40 19 it turns out that a
9 21 goes back a long time
13 19 time when he was in
9 26 now the secretary of state
33 28 arrival in the united states
10 17 had to be used to
7 26 out over the pacific ocean
8 25 held the screen door open
14 22 you begin to wonder if
8 22 went up to the counter
8 19 only way to know if
12 23 i would have known what
23 21 the way men and women
7 22 enough to keep out the
12 31 articles published in the first
9 35 of the american library association
6 25 find it extremely hard to
14 18 for the owner of a
6 22 much better than it is
7 26 between two people who are
7 20 it also doubles as a
6 28 when are you getting married
8 22 stand to lose the most
7 23 and i are still friends
7 21 that would make you a
6 20 when he was done and
7 31 messages back and forth between
8 21 so that you know what
6 24 men who lost their lives
15 28 has focused attention on the
6 24 for taking the time this
6 20 to the same sorts of
11 20 have been on his way
7 18 a big deal to have
18 24 understand what it is to
6 26 to acknowledge the role of
77 21 but i think that what
7 22 you better be ready to
6 24 as a basis for political
6 27 verge of becoming the first
10 20 are hard to find and
6 25 just the past three years
15 22 the kind of player who
9 24 write about in your book
8 23 leaders in an effort to

6 18 it is a real issue
18 22 and then the other one
16 22 are taking a hard look
6 23 the second quarter on a

8 17 of a decade or so
7 20 i still feel like it
7 21 came out on the other
9 26 the question of whether an

12 21 it was pretty easy to
10 21 the first half with a
38 16 do i have to say
15 29 not discriminate on the basis
9 22 a part of our national

8 20 it will be the worst
17 21 he had learned how to

6 18 used to wake up in
11 27 chairman and ceo of johnson
9 23 more you know about the

7 23 get a chance to explain
31 21 and get on with their
7 19 held up a sign that
14 25 is a good indication that
31 24 the first and the second

6 27 beginning of a new congress
6 21 a great place to make
12 20 he was a changed man
24 18 i knew it was true
6 20 that have to be paid
7 19 need to make a good
57 20 in order to obtain a
7 19 does not serve as a
16 17 was that we had a
7 20 that and you know it
6 16 to do is keep it
9 21 in areas of the brain
14 23 have the latest on that
8 24 the windows open and the
9 18 to be based in the

19 22 that there was no time
7 22 set the tone for their
30 20 very hard for him to
11 16 to be done is to
10 25 are considered by many to
7 18 and what we saw in
8 18 i was a product of
8 26 the opportunity to get out
6 28 of a number of organizations
7 21 to talk about sex and
10 21 a free agent from the
8 26 most important role in the
11 20 and that he would do
6 23 not have been caused by
12 19 will be hell to pay
6 20 soon as this is over
7 23 and gestured for her to
10 19 is about as much as
10 29 realized how important it was
6 31 that although the united states
8 18 so can you tell me
14 20 needs to be taken to
8 38 associated with optimum youth outcomes
12 19 that he is a person
10 21 whom he had never met

11 20 want to stand up for
6 20 in a house where the
14 28 that somewhere along the way
10 32 research has been conducted with
6 17 i think i made it
60 15 if we can do it
6 20 he rolls his eyes at
10 22 the first pitch at the
16 20 out the other end of
11 19 is the kind of case
12 18 in the eye when he
8 22 that there will be two
7 24 jews and arabs in israel
13 17 we are out of the
16 23 the contents of the bag
10 23 it does not explain why

7 19 make a point of not
7 23 what the defense has to

6 23 was that so many people
28 23 things that i think are
6 22 a legend in the making
44 20 money is going to be
45 23 no one really knows how
9 20 a week ahead of time
7 24 it is impossible to draw
15 27 the dramatic changes in the

7 27 places like the middle east
12 21 not to be left behind
8 24 and there were many more
16 25 to get the government out

26 17 so if you were to
15 19 amount to a kind of
6 22 they all belong to the

6 20 the first to do that
8 19 the song is about a
14 24 inside the back cover of

20 24 what more could you want
6 23 holding it close to his
13 23 with his arm around her
7 23 for all these years and
77 18 on how you look at
9 23 back in the middle ages
9 22 a general sense of the
8 19 off the road at the
8 19 do and what you can
9 25 measure the impact of the
6 21 have a lot of special
6 20 that part of that is
6 21 get out of the public
6 24 with two children in the

18 21 how do they know that
6 28 in terms of the conventional
7 24 she could have done this
6 22 until at least the end
13 26 if they thought they could
6 28 the degree of involvement in

9 32 members of the medical community
7 20 to sit down and make
7 22 a distance of at least
7 19 tell me what he did
7 19 or it may simply be
7 25 is a matter of preference
6 17 as a copy boy and
6 24 the risks that come with
6 32 who build a democratic classroom
21 24 a very different type of
91 22 what makes you think i
12 18 i just put my head
12 19 rise in the rate of
8 20 not want any part of
6 23 is the resting place of
7 18 the end of my term
8 32 relatively small fraction of the

8 20 is a great honor and
7 22 of the lateness of the
7 20 that i wanted to try
10 25 i crossed the finish line
8 17 i would give it a
9 26 methods used in this study
8 21 we have a law against
7 23 are good on minnows and
6 24 the size of the building
7 19 run them out of the
10 20 which i took to mean
10 18 the time and i was
10 27 have raised the question of
23 19 can do only so much
9 22 i look at that picture
10 21 just get a little bit
9 16 has a hole in it
6 26 at the united nations last
7 23 he was asked about that
25 22 i think they were just
6 33 peaceful resolution of the taiwan
12 19 to see that some of
7 17 as a woman of the
7 22 half an hour later the
16 20 they need to get the
13 22 come as a big surprise
18 20 are going to wake up

16 25 thought that was a little
12 24 they opened the door and
122 25 something to do with that
7 24 the kids were growing up
18 24 and for some reason that
7 27 to view the planets evening
7 29 middle ground between the two

6 20 in which we now find
6 23 had talked on the phone
16 17 you have a job to
6 21 known to be a problem
9 27 on a more fundamental level
11 23 have to make some tough
6 21 does not have to give
18 28 ongoing lessons and units of
6 41 serious emotional and behavioral problems
8 23 first thing i would say
7 23 they go straight to the
25 22 both sides of an issue
57 21 it is ironic that the
19 15 it was up to us
7 21 which is the story of
9 21 to keep all the money
9 21 has to live with this
8 23 his first season on the

11 21 to have been used for
6 34 the relationship between the party
6 21 in order to feel like
12 23 was not large enough to
9 28 how many thousands of people
11 24 and the attention of the
13 31 social work and nurse discharge
9 19 stand as one of the
36 21 come to grips with it
7 19 part of a policy to

6 19 as to what they can
19 20 that was used by the

27 20 but he made it clear
11 28 evidence for the presence of
6 23 the best course for the
12 21 to enlist in the army
8 19 a chance to come up
11 18 i have no money to
10 19 be back with a word
7 19 i have not found it
7 23 it felt wonderful to be
10 24 question has to be asked

6 20 the one that kind of
15 21 still much work to be
8 29 and walked slowly through the

8 24 going to make more money
12 28 i think that the prosecution
31 17 a whole hell of a
10 27 there is also concern about

51 23 we have every reason to
6 24 the line between being a

6 23 of people that would be
11 19 not a person who is

6 17 but my view is we
95 32 welcome back to reliable sources
10 26 children from all over the

12 28 the results of an experiment
6 18 and went as far as

6 19 to do what it needs
6 30 months after the completion of

36 20 you can also use the
6 32 eastern united states and canada

6 19 out of the club and
6 24 make enough money on the
9 18 on the door in the
10 21 can be likened to the
7 24 gotten out of the shower
6 19 to come to terms on
9 28 to convince the country that
6 28 that what the president said
9 32 researchers found that those who
7 26 susceptible to the kind of
23 18 able to live up to
41 23 i have to remind myself
25 20 i barely had time to
23 21 all the way over here
6 20 the media and to the
6 17 is a tough nut to
8 19 this is an issue on
7 19 and after a year or
7 20 her mother had had a
47 25 democracy and the rule of
28 19 a lot of that going
18 23 which has become one of
8 15 up at me like a

14 24 if the democrats want to
122 34 slide and digital entries accepted
13 29 about the authenticity of the

6 23 majority of the rest of
7 25 the best response to this
6 15 up a hand as if
6 27 not in a financial position
28 19 was a woman who had
8 29 victimization at the hands of
6 22 do a brisk business in
278 19 you have to be able
17 15 find it to be a
10 26 what the president said is
7 20 and in that case the
16 18 we have to wait to
7 18 of the four men on
13 23 down in the parking lot
16 26 in terms of their personal
12 19 a true sense of the
6 28 a fractured sense of dignity
26 18 even at the age of
9 26 games have been decided by
28 24 one of the most eloquent
6 26 still trying to track down
20 19 on a hill above the
14 22 tears came to his eyes
10 25 when she talked about the
6 18 get a lot of stuff
11 22 holds on for dear life
20 26 is there a double standard
20 25 the white house about the
6 23 page of the los angeles
13 23 at least three of these
36 15 as much as i am
9 21 they tried to get him
16 23 the top of their agenda
7 25 he became involved in the
7 24 where he is scheduled to
7 32 more than a little uncomfortable
13 21 in the telling of the
6 26 more complex than has been
6 21 the reality is we are
8 20 were put up for sale
6 31 the communities from which they
12 18 the sex of a child
8 32 of the most conservative members
10 23 the jobs that are being
7 17 if he lived to be

12 25 to happen in this country
10 37 most qualified individuals for judges
8 25 at a relatively low level
6 25 was working as a security
8 22 to be something we can
10 18 but let me say one
29 21 nail in the coffin of

7 18 know is that it is
11 24 in the central time zone
7 22 can be drawn about the

7 21 as healthy as a horse
45 24 was never intended to be
14 23 of their time trying to
23 24 will be available on the
6 19 me because i was so
7 24 into bottom and sides of
8 29 to understand what that means
16 27 took over management of the

7 22 from the window of her
6 19 make quite a bit of
16 22 they are very close to
6 19 who died a year ago
56 21 more of your calls at

6 20 i was living at home
6 25 who led the opposition to
7 23 that has always been my
6 28 something new to worry about
9 20 go from door to door
18 25 a standard of living that
6 22 the first thing he has
6 22 get out of this crisis

6 23 talk about that all the
8 20 i always tried to be
13 24 saying that they want to
6 19 he went on to state
19 17 i was told by one
8 20 she felt sick to her

7 25 days before the war began
10 23 before they went to bed
6 20 now all they have to
8 22 come back and they say
6 26 cook the bacon until crisp
13 18 so did most of the
8 24 a dispute over who would
6 25 comparison to some of the
6 29 research fellow at the center
6 21 eat three times a day
6 26 made a particular point of
9 23 just trying to give you
21 19 on in the middle of
12 27 signing of the peace treaty
6 32 one of the greatest difficulties
8 22 he turned and began to
8 24 the ways in which gender
9 19 and you have a real

8 17 me ask you let me
14 25 now more than ever before
20 18 him at his home in
6 21 moment i fell in love
6 19 what you had in the
6 19 to get the group to
6 33 participants were asked how often

8 17 do i look like an
6 21 they used to have the

8 28 that the government had been
14 26 his engineering job and is
10 19 as a weapon of mass
7 23 and the result could be
6 20 and how much time is
9 19 the time i was able
10 24 that you did not believe
6 24 the table and headed for
16 22 but what i really want
50 20 stand up in front of
7 23 the early stages of her
6 29 the united states could never

15 25 felt that they were being
7 30 of this administration and the
11 25 a metal blade and process
6 19 must say i think it
7 22 i moved to los angeles
10 26 share a common interest in

9 19 so out of step with
9 22 when he turned to face

6 33 the researcher and the researched
7 26 will keep you from getting
6 31 writing specialty and make more
25 22 that you are not going
11 25 america is brought to you
6 21 to help create a more
10 24 what has been termed the
26 21 seats in the house of

8 30 of school crime and disruption
8 18 i was too smart to
129 21 we are in the process
7 21 so long that he could
7 18 and have a list of
6 19 able to fill in the
6 22 the expense of its own
7 20 you came out here to
20 23 they have a very strong
16 17 to one of the big

23 21 does it mean that the
6 26 record on civil rights and
7 31 were really concerned about the
14 17 is to try to help

12 29 couple of questions from this
9 23 even at this early hour
12 19 going to mean a lot
6 25 would be difficult to put
18 22 but i think the bottom
